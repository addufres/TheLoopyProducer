No introduction is needed for one of the greatest minds in American history. Albert Einstein understood and applied this principle in his life's work. Think back, to when he was struggling in school as a young child. Yet, even at this age he had grand visions of what his value could be. His path to success was not to focus on success. Rather, it was to forge his path through following his vision and dreams for himself. This meant bringing value to the world, through his scientific and technological advancements.
<h4>What is "becoming a man of value"?</h4>
In my life, I have held the belief that if you create something that people want then the money and success will follow naturally. I mean <em>come on, </em>this whole website is devoted to helping others succeed. I want to have the peace of mind at the end of the day that I have helped somebody. If I can help one person then I am a success. The more value I create with what I bring to the table, the more success I will reach.

The Value that is brought to the table can come in many forms. To some of you it may mean being a present and loving parent. Or, teaching your kid to be the best version of themselves through example. To some, it could mean finally going ahead and starting that business. Maybe, beginning that blog or advice column. Value can come in many forms but the important part is living your life through those values. Rather than, living through the vain outlook of wanting appreciation or "success".
<h4>How have I applied this concept?</h4>
For start, The Loopy Producer is a content based site. It is aimed at providing success coaching and motivational information for building the best life for yourself. This is to aid every person who comes here. I make sure that this site, and the information within, is FREE and accessible to everyone. To me there is no greater value than the gift of knowledge.

However, knowledge alone is not power. Application of that knowledge is where the real power lies. Primarily, it is this reason why mentorship offered here is so important to me to remain FREE. Without available coaching on the material here, it is extremely hard to apply the knowledge. I stumbled blind for years collecting tidbits of information. The whole time, not ever knowing quite where to make the first step.

Once I found <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://my.wealthyaffiliate.com/createaccount?a_aid=0337277e">Wealthy Affiliate</a></span></strong>, that all changed. I found a portal and path to develop and share valuable content to the world. This is all so I can live by the principles I preach. Wealthy affiliate, by the way is <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://my.wealthyaffiliate.com/createaccount?a_aid=0337277e">FREE</a> </span></strong>as well and you get a discounted first month of<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://my.wealthyaffiliate.com/order/signup?a_aid=0337277e">PREMIUM</a> </span></strong>with my offer code.
