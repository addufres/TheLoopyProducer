<h2>Building A Home Studio - Under $1000</h2>
Welcome to the first posting of many on The Loopy Producer.  I figure it's only fitting that the first post on my "make music and make money from home" blog be one for the total 100% newbie. If this is you you are most likely just beginning your search. Or possibly, you have had poor experience getting past the learning curve of some piece of music equipment. If this is you than you probably don't know the answers to these questions.<img class="alignright wp-image-225" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pro-home-studio-300x169.jpg" alt="building a home studio" width="334" height="188" />

<em><strong>What do I need for music production? </strong></em>

<em><strong>What music production software is best for beginners? </strong></em>

<em><strong>How do I amass my own recording equipment and become a music producer on a budget?</strong></em>

If you don't that is perfect because you will be able to by the end of this article. You came here to learn how to become a music producer. Consider me a producer of future producers. I believe that you will see the value in this budget music production studio setup, as it took years for me to find the difference between all the cheap and crap products (that ends up costing you money and time)  and the properly built and designed budget conscious music making equipment.

The goal of this is to show YOU, the home studio producer, that even though this is an expensive industry there are ways for newcomers to get involved with music production and be building a home studio for music production under $1000. Which, in hindsight, I wish that someone had told me all these things before I went and spent several thousand on equipment I didn't need let alone know how to use.<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.theloopyproducer.com/sonymdr-7506">Click here for Part 1</a></span></strong>
