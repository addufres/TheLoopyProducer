<h2>Music Tutorials That Set You Up for Success</h2>
The last time I checked on Google, there are well over 1,000,000 products and music tutorials claiming to make your beats better, make your beats sell, get people to notice you. Some even claim to have the next hit waiting right behind their sales page.

The problem is most music tutorials assume you have the right equipment and software for the type of music you produce. They assume you know the basics.

<strong><em>The reality couldn't be further from that...</em></strong>

The vast majority of music producers are just starting out, and for a company to assume you already know how to begin and streamline is plain ignorant.
<h4>I will not assume that</h4>
My music tutorials are easy to read. These step by step tutorials are aimed at getting your home music studio up and running with minimal snags. Hence, each music tutorial revolves around the products and equipment I discuss on my<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> <a style="color: #3366ff;" href="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/music-production-gear">music production</a></span></strong> page and<strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"> <a style="color: #3366ff;" href="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/fund-your-passions">fund your passion</a></span></strong> page.

Making music can be one of the most rewarding activities. Therefore, knowing you have the ability to take something that began as a thought and transform it, is magic. In order for you to maximize your ability to compose and create, you must have your workflow down to a science.

Before I learned how to set up and prepare my interfaces for when it was time to work, I would stumble through the same process for each new song. I will show you how to take the music production equipment and software you invest in, and simplify the process of setting up.
<h3>Do You Have Any Special Requests?</h3>
I will do several music tutorials per week. Therefore, if there is a product question that you would like me to teach on here, please leave a comment below. I will be more than happy to feature your request in upcoming posts.
