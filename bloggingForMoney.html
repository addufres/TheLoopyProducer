<h2>Is Blogging and Making Money Online for me? How to Make Money With A Blog</h2>
I asked myself several questions when making the decision to start blogging and making money from it. If anyone is similar, I imagine many of you 
are wondering the same things. Making the decision to move online and make money with a Wordpress blog is a big decision, and one that must be properly 
thought out to give you the best chance of success blogging and making money.
<h5><em>What niche do I choose for my Wordpress blog?<a href="http://www.wealthyaffiliate.com?a_aid=0337277e"><img class="alignright" 
    src="https://my.wealthyaffiliate.com/banners/show/wa_uncover_secrets_250x250.jpg" border="0" /></a></em></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The niche you choose in the most simple of terms should be something that you are passionate about. This may seem like a
     given but be prepared to spend hours writing content on your niche of choice. Anything can be monetized on the internet. So, whether you are into 
     "dieting and exercise in the senior community" or you are into writing a blog on "how to make money online blogging" there will always be an audience 
     to market your content to. So pick something you love and get writing. I used the training and support at <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">
         <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.wealthyaffiliate.com/a_aid/0337277e/campaign/wacustomandrewd">Wealthy Affiliate</a></span></strong> 
         to learn the basics and begin my journey in blogging and making money. I highly suggest checking out their FREE training and support!</p>

<h5><em>How do I build the website?</em></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Twenty years ago you had to know how to code in several languages to effectively create a beautiful customized webpage for your
     business or blog. Luckily thanks to the user friendly Wordpress platform, anyone and everyone with an idea and a vision can create their website for free 
     and be up and running within a days time. The only other things to worry about with building a website is site hosting and domain names. I use<strong>
         <span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.siterubix.com?a_aid=0337277e">SiteRubix</a></span></strong> to host my 
         website. They have fantastic support and can accommodate up to 500K unique visitors per website per month (plenty for any newcomer to making money online).
          Lucky they are<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.siterubix.com?a_aid=0337277e">FREE</a></span>
        </strong> for Wealthy Affiliate members.</p>

<h5><em>Should I use affiliate marketing programs?</em></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am partial to this method as there are literally tens of thousands of companies out there willing to pay you to promote their 
    brand and build customers for them. You do this again through your content. When deciding on these programs however, it is important to stick with 
    legitimate and well founded organizations. Lots of bad stigma gets associated</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">with affiliate programs, mostly do to trash "gurus" spewing garbage to vulnerable folks.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">However, making money with affiliate advertising and affiliate product reviews has been and still is one of the easiest means for a new 
    website owner to begin monetizing and drawing traffic towards their homepage. You just need to choose wisely and write things people like reading. I have learned
    everything I know from the good people over at Wealthy Affiliate. For over a decade they have provided extensive resources and training on how to succeed in affiliate 
    marketing, as well as a thriving community of entrepreneurs to interact, collaborate and grow together. Check them out for free<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">

<h5><em>What methods will I use to be blogging and making money on it?</em></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Beginning out I recommend using only free methods of generating presence and traffic to your Wordpress blog. I began with a FREE Amazon Affiliate 
    Account and some relevant affiliate programs within my niche. I doubled down on my niche to broaden my reach and decided on "home music production tips for making better music
     and starting a business online" In addition to affiliate programs I use Google Adsense which pushes relevant advertising to dedicated space on each of my pages. All of these 
     programs are 100% FREE to join and use and will make a world of difference when you take the plunge and begin blogging and making money online.</p>
And most importantly...
<h5><em>Is it really possible to make money with a Wordpress blog?</em></h5>
Getting started with your online blogging can seem like a large task when looked at in completion. Most people imagine a blog that already has a following and a dedicated audience 
and says something like...

<em>Well i can't choose that niche, I could never compete!</em>

Guess what??
<h5><strong><em>There are 2 billion people on the internet!</em></strong></h5>

It does not matter what you choose to write about, there are people who are looking to read just that. So to make this process less daunting I have assembled 10 ways to begin making 
money on a Wordpress blog. I handpicked these tips to get you off the ground fast. The sooner you are on your way to building something of your own, the sooner you succeed. These will
 hopefully make navigating your new world of blogging and making money online just a little less confusing.
<h2><strong>10 Steps for Starting a Wordpress Blog</strong></h2>
<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">I suggest following these steps in a separate window while reading. That way by the end of this article you have a website set up and you are 
    on your way to success!</span></strong>
<h3>1. What is your "WHY"?</h3>
This is the single most important factor of your success in blogging and making money online. I will be continuing to go over and develop this bracket in future articles. Why? Why is
 it worth it to you to push through the parts where it is not enjoyable. What motivates you to share and teach, and how is that being used to propel you towards success?

<em>Only you can answer that..</em>

I say this as number one on the list because before any of the other parts can be implemented, you need to know your "why". A "why" can be anything. For me, I do this to create a better
 future for my children then I had. Not that I was destitute growing up or didn't have clothes or food. Rather, I knew that I wanted to be able to be at home with my family, instead of 
 in a cubicle farm 10 hours a day. I knew that the only way for me to leave an imprint was to get out and start a business.

<h3>2. Deciding on your Niche</h3>
This should build off of your why. Assuming your why is personal to you and your goals, I would imagine it allows you to utilize and build on your current passions. Don't get 
caught up in the word "niche". A niche is nothing more than the topic of your website. For example the niche I chose for The Loopy Producer is turning passions into profits. 
In more detail, my niche is my own case study of taking my passion for writing, music production, and internet marketing and creating a business from it.

Common niches for bloggers include:
<ul>
 	<li>weight loss tips for women</li>
 	<li>childrens clothing age 1-3</li>
 	<li>home theater reviews</li>
 	<li>guitar lessons and tutorials</li>
 	<li>swingset options for families</li>
</ul>
So on and so forth... As you can see those are just some ideas. A niche can cover any possible topic you could come up with. Being that there are billions of people online, 
it is just a matter of choosing something that resonates with you and taking the plunge. Don't focus too hard on this as you will find it naturally as you develop your page.
 During that process you will seat in one niche that feels right.
<h3>3. Domain and Hosting</h3>
It would be pretty hard to be blogging and making money online without a place for people to find you. Think of your domain as your house and the hosting as the Homeowner's 
Association that makes sure all the homes are in proper order. The domain you choose will be the URL that visitors search for so typically they are broken into two kinds.
<ul>
 	<li>A keyword centered domain name would be keyword heavy to allow for easier search rankings (possibly).
<ul>
 	<li>niche = weight loss for women</li>
 	<li>domain = "womensweightlosstips" dot com</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>A branded domain name would be something to create a recognizable brand from your site.
<ul>
 	<li>niche = music production tips and making money online</li>
 	<li>domain = theloopyproducer.com</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
The choice is up to you and will be dictated by your personal goals and plans for your business. If you are unsure which to use for your first site feel free to use<strong>
    <span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.siterubix.com?a_aid=0337277e">SiteRubix</a></span></strong> to secure several free domains 
    and see which ones work best for your application. Once you are ready to transfer to a paid domain they will make the transition and purchasing painless. I use SiteRubix for 
    all of my domain hosting and purchasing, and will continue due to the community and support available. Read my full review of SiteRubix here. Click<span style="color: #0000ff;">
        <strong> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.siterubix.com?a_aid=0337277e">here </a></strong></span>to head to SiteRubix and set up your free site.
<h3>4. Choosing your Theme</h3>
Past the content, the layout of feel of your website will have the biggest impact on your success and visitor experience. I am sure you have been to a blog or Wordpress site that felt 
cheaply made and uninviting. It may have had confusing menus or bad links. Most likely, it looked plain and nothing stood out. Luckily, today there are thousands of free, responsive
 Wordpress themes available for everyone to use.

Wordpress makes up for 25% of webpages on the internet and as such it is important to choose a theme that can be customized and made into your own. Many themes offer a free version of 
their respective premium themes. These free versions tend to include a majority of the premium features making them great options from the get go.

When choosing a theme it is important to think of the types of content that will be on your website. If it is mainly text then a theme offering a majority of the main page to pictures
 and media may not suit you as well as a clean magazine type format. Go browse through the themes available here at <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" 
    href="https://wordpress.com/themes/">wordpress.com</a></span></strong>. Download any that you like and as you build your page try out the different ones you have. I tried 7 different 
themes before deciding on my current pallet.
<h3>5. Building the Basics</h3>
<em>A good foundation will allow you spread your wings.</em>

There are four pages that any successful Wordpress blog includes <img class="wp-image-290 alignleft" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gpics-1.jpg" 
alt="blogging and making money" width="353" height="179" />to ensure that Google likes them in addition to their readers. These pages lay the groundwork for a XML Sitemap, which is a 
must in getting indexed through search engines. In addition to being needed for the techie stuff, they give your reader a chance to learn a bit about whats behind the domain name.

<em>Real people like real people...</em>

The "Must Have" pages for any website are:
<h5><strong>About Me </strong></h5>
This is where you put a face to the website you have created. This is not an about the website page. You are the focus of this content. So talk about yourself, your qualifications,
 how you got started in this niche, what your hobbies and goals are. What are your dreams? All of these topics go into creating the personality that people will think of when reading 
 your content. The less faceless you seem the less cold your visitors will be. People like understanding who is giving them advice. I am sure you are much more likely to listen to the 
 advice of a friend or colleague, over that of a random passerby on the street. The goal is between 500-1000 words on who you are and how you got to where you are today doing this website.

For ideas check out my<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/about-me">About Me</a></span></strong>. I also 
recommend looking at other websites in your niche, to get a feel for how they write their About Me pages.
<h5><strong>Overview or Mission</strong></h5>
This in its most simple for is nothing more than a mission statement or end goal for why this website is up. It can be seen as an about me for your business. This is the page that people 
who come to your website go to see if they can gain value from being there.<img class="wp-image-292 alignright" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gpics-2.jpg" 
alt="blogging and making money" width="533" height="325" />

<em>What things will you be covering in your blog? </em>

<em>What problem are you fixing by creating this website?</em>

<em>When all is said and done, what will your readers learn and come away with?</em>

This webpage will be very specific to your chosen niche. Given that circumstance, it is not good advice to say write this or write that. What I will say is if you answer the above questions, 
you will have a well thought out and organized Overview page.

For an example to draw formatting ideas from here is my <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/what-we-do">
    What We Do</a></span></strong> page.

&nbsp;
<h5><strong>Niche specific page to organize all categories and posts</strong></h5>
This is the top level page for your niche posts. This can be an introduction page for a specific part of your niche, or you may have a few as I do to cover the broader categories within 
your niche. However you decide to organize it, these pages should be a good starting point for your readers and should be linked to from the Overview page. Having these internal links 
creates a structure to the site and allows an easier time for the visitor to navigate quickly between pages.

In this page I would focus on going more into detail about the specifics within your niche that you are planning to cover with posts in the future. This gives the reader a reason to come
 back in the future. When you properly break down your niche for the reader, you are providing groundwork for the growth and development of your site down the road. Having a good foundation 
 is key, and a recurring theme when beginning blogging with the intent to make money.

<h3>6. Your First Post</h3>
Congratulations! By now, you should have a website set up and several pages posted! It is time to begin the creation phase. This is the meat and potatoes of your website. 
Blogging and making money online as a living has never been closer. Therefore, it is imperative that dedication and focus be given at 100% for every post you make. It is the factor 
that decides whether a website sinks or swims.

<em>"Content is not scary"</em>

Before, when I had no grasp on how the internet worked with regards to blogging and making money, I was terrified by the idea of content creation. I had no idea what that meant, 
but the sound of it was intimidating enough to not pursue my dreams for several years. It was not until I met Kyle and Carson over at Wealthy Affiliate, that I gained comfort in knowing 
that I was a content creation factory and so are each and every one of you. They described it as just being able to communicate. Simple as that with no strings attached. Content is the
 "stuff" you like about your niche and all the "things" you want to say. Content can be videos, pictures, stories, tips, tutorials etc. Anything you want just make sure to write relevant 
 information as quality of content is far superior to quantity of content.

So get writing or posting and don't ever look back! Take a look at some of my reviews for ideas on different ways to layout a blog post:

<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/native-instruments-maschine-mkii">Native Instruments Maschine MKII</a></span></strong>

<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/focusrite-scarlett-2i2-review">Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 USB Audio Interface</a></span></strong>

<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/sonymdr-7506">Sony MDR-7506 Headphones</a></span></strong>
<h3>7. What is SEO</h3>
SEO or "Search Engine Optimization" is one of the ways that you get your website found by other
people and begin generating traffic on its own. There are entire websites dedicated to teaching just SEO.<img class="size-full wp-image-289 alignright" 
src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gpics-3.png" alt="blogging and making money" width="304" height="166" />
This should hint at how in depth this concept can go. As a general rule of thumb though SEO involves doing research into keywords and then implementing them into the posts and meta tags.
 There is so much more involved and for a beginner I recommend setting up an all-in-one type SEO plugin on your website to help the learning curve. This also helps to keep you SEO'd while
  you are learning what it all entails. I use the plugin YoastSEO from Wordpress plugins for free. It follows each of my posts and tags and gives specific tips to improve SEO quality and 
  post rank better. You can download it<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">HERE</a> </span></strong>for free.
<h3>8. Time to Monetize</h3>
When just starting out, I recommend that you join Amazon Affiliates to have the ability to include free advertising and the ability to earn per referral right from the get go. With Amazon 
Affiliates you have access to rotating banners, HTML embed code for any link you want on Amazon. In addition, you get the ability to set up and embed a storefront on your website. Amazon 
has a tremendous amount of opportunity available for those just starting a blog.

Take a look at my Amazon store <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://astore.amazon.com/theloopyprodu-20">here</a></span></strong>.

Another method is the thousands of affiliate programs available for any and every topic imaginable. Companies all over the world are looking for people to promote them. Lucky for you, you
 have a website that is set up to do just that! With the addition of affiliate programs and sidebar advertising you will be able to not only promote them with advertising, but create 
 targeted posts about specific products and services. Blogging and making money has never been more accessible thanks to places like<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> 
     <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.cj.com/what-is-affiliate-marketing">Commision Junction</a></span></strong> and<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">
         <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.clickbank.com/">Clickbank</a></span></strong>. These affiliate marketplaces are good starting points to scour for affiliate 
         programs to promote.
<h3>9. Getting Help</h3>
<a href="http://www.wealthyaffiliate.com?a_aid=0337277e"><img class="alignleft" src="https://my.wealthyaffiliate.com/banners/show/wa_successful_business_120x600.jpg" width="97" 
    height="485" border="0" /></a>As is important with any endeavor, blogging and making money online require guidance and support. There will be countless times when you just are 
    lost in the sauce. There may have been times moving throughout this article that you thought, "Darn, what about this...or that?". Having a mentor or support structure for your 
    learning process is imperative to success down the road. Sure, you could ask your buddy but more likely he will tell you to do one thing he heard online somewhere that "probably 
    works". Or, the more likely response of, "oh, don't even bother. Blogging and making money isn't possible".

<em>Great support... </em>

This is not unique by any means. Most people encounter the same thing when asking family and friends for help on a blogging and making money journey. In my opinion it is just 
them manifesting their own doubts and fears for their success on you, the person out there striving for more. With regards to this issue, I recommend finding and joining a group 
of like minded entrepreneurs who are always more than willing to lend a hand to the new guy on the block.

My solution to that is<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.wealthyaffiliate.com?a_aid=0337277e">Wealthy Affiliate</a></span></strong>. 
In addition to the training and sheer know-how on the site, the community is more personally involved than most Facebook users. Every one is blogging and making money online. As far as 
social networking goes, they are a bit in a league of their own. There are no memes and advertisement filled timelines. Just simple straightforward advice, tutorials and discussions 
about blogging and making money. Check them out <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.wealthyaffiliate.com/a_aid/0337277e/campaign/wacustomandrewd">
    here</a></span></strong>.
<h3>10. A Plan Moving Forward</h3>
It is important with any endeavor, to have a solid plan of attack. When committing to blogging and making money with it you must set up for long term success. This is a trickle, stream,
 river type of industry. In this case it means setting goals, and target achievements. This last step requires some participation. In order to make your goals real and make it harder 
 for you back out on them, write your goals down. In the comments below write out your goals for:<img class=" wp-image-286 alignright" 
 src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gpics-2-1024x512.png" alt="blogging and making money" width="372" height="186" />
<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">30 days out</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">90 days out</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">6 months out</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">1 year out</li>
</ul>
It is important to phrase your goals as if you have completed them already. This is a neat little psychology trick I learned from mentors over the years. This is so that when you 
read them each day you are literally thinking of them as a reality. As you will learn about down the road, your thoughts control your reality. So for example

DON'T = I will have a website with ten posts by six months out

DO = After six months of website developement, I have posted ten articles.

The difference is subtle but present none the less. There is a separate article covering goals setting and the S.M.A.R.T. technique in the works. Stay tuned for growth and updates.
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
This was a lengthy post and if you made it this far, I congratulate you on your commitment towards your success with blogging and making money online. We covered a lot in this, and
 I hope I answered any questions that may have arisen. In addition I hope that if you followed along, that you now have a website or at least have the tools to get it done. If there
  are ANY questions at all regarding this how to, please leave a comment below and I will respond usually within a day!

Remember to LIKE, SHARE, and COMMENT

As always thank you for letting me share this with you. To greener pastures on the other side, may your goals be attained and dreams achieved.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287"
