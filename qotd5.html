<h4><em>"Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game." - President Donald J. Trump</em></h4>

Trump (from the<strong> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">White House</a></strong>)[/caption]

President Trump has had one of the more controversial stories circulating the world today. Luckily this website has ZERO to do with politics. And I personally could not give less of a crap about opinions on his presidency.

Good. Now that's out of the way, we can focus on what he is saying and what his tremendous business accomplishments have been throughout the decades. Donald J. Trump has built a multi-billion dollar company out of a comparatively small loan from his father. Through the entirety of his career as titan of industry, President Trump has repeatedly made reference to the fun he has in "playing the game". The money in his eyes is just the trophy you get for playing well.

I can appreciate this view and I believe the principles behind it have permeated into my own life. Including my focus on value rather than profits.
<h4>So what does President Trump mean?</h4>

<hr />

This actually builds off of a Quote Of The Day about a week ago. In that one I talked about creating value and how success will follow naturally. In this quote President Trump explains how the money comes second. Always. His focus is enjoyment and feeling fulfilled in life.

Being able to go home at the end of the day and know that you created and brought value to the world should always come first. If you keep this in the forefront of your actions and intentions, then you will have success follow naturally.

As he puts it, he enjoys playing the game. So play the game of life. Learn to roll with the punches and claim your spot ahead when the opportunity presents itself. Life is meant to be enjoyable. Otherwise, we wouldn't spend so much time trying to enjoy it. Learning to play the game of life and excel is a lifelong task. But, playing the game...and playing it <em>WELL, </em>will bring success and financial stability into your life.
<h4>Then what is the goal?</h4>
The goal is to do what you love and love what you do. It is the American dream. Family, hobbies, and time to devote to both. That is why I started this website. I want to help people achieve their goals in life. In doing that I will hopefully (if I continue to help people) be able to use this as a full time income.

By doing what I love, and finding a way to monetize my hobby (funding my passions) has allowed me the freedom. President Trump is spot on. If I focused on the money right now...HAHAHAHA! There is none. I do this for you guys. My handful of readers. The only way I make money is through ads in the side bars from Google. And some affiliate linking here and there.

If I was in this for the money I would have stopped before I ever began. Once the money starts to come in, it is nothing more than an affirmation that what I am passionate about is having the intended effect on my readers. If I am making money, it means I am helping people to succeed in life. And what if anything is the goal other than that.
