<h1>How To Make An Incredible <em>About Me</em> Page</h1>

<hr />

It is no secret that every blogger out there has mastered the art of telling people about themselves and the things they enjoy. It is also no secret that not many do it well. Many people see an <em>About Me</em> page as a small piece to the <em>whole</em> that is their site.

The part many people overlook is the trust that is built with a quality and well put together page about yourself. Being able to identify a real person helps build rapport much better than a "perfect site"

Lucky for you, it is one of the easier pages to create for your website. The quality of your <em>About Me</em> will be a big factor in people choosing to keep reading or head to the next guy in google. These tips are designed to do just that...<strong><em>Keep your readers reading</em></strong>.

So without further delay...
<h2>6 Tips To Make An <em>About Me</em> Page People Actually Want To Read</h2>

<hr />

<h3><strong>1. Show your face</strong></h3>
Yes that means showing your ugly mug to the world and putting yourself out there. Think about it...if you go to a bloggers website and venture over to the A<em>bout Me</em> page, I guarantee that you will see their shining smiling face somewhere on that page. People like to know who they are listening to or taking advice from. It is fairly straightforward. Just put a nice picture of you on there.

<img class="alignright wp-image-355" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cropped-Andrew-Picture.jpg" alt="The Loopy Producer About Me Page Photo" width="244" height="332" />

That doesn't mean go out and get professional head shots taken. Seriously, the point of this whole blog is to show people they can go after their dreams and passions without having to go broke doing it. So find some good pictures on Facebook or Instagram of you enjoying life. Mind you, there only needs to be a couple of pictures total.

Here are some ideas of pictures to include:
<ul>
 	<li>You doing what you love i.e. hobbies, sports, activities (see pic right)</li>
 	<li>You and your family</li>
 	<li>A nice shot from a recent trip</li>
</ul>
Things to leave private:
<ul>
 	<li>Night out photos (unless that is your niche)</li>
 	<li>Blurry group photos where you are not easily picked out</li>
 	<li>Political or religious photos (again...unless that is your niche)</li>
</ul>
Now that everyone knows what you look like...
<h3><strong>2. Tell Us Your Story</strong></h3>
This should be obvious, but this will fill the majority of this page. This is your opportunity to rant and tell your readers all about what built you. Where did you grow up? What hobbies do you have? What pushed you to start your business or blog?

All of these concepts will eventually become the foundation for your image to your readers. An <em>About Me</em> page is where your readers will get the information they tell their friends about you. These small things in the beginning if done right can this can aid your success 10-fold down the road.

Having a devoted group of listeners or readers is impossible if they don't know who they are listening to. You should come across as someone your readers can relate with. Think about it...do you trust someone off the street you have never met before? Your answer, I hope, is "of course not Andrew...Jeez."

Then why should people trust you. Being a blogger or business owner does not make you instantly trustworthy. So treat others the way you hope to be treated online. Make them feel welcome and like they are chatting with a friend.

Once they know your story...
<h3><strong>3. Tell Us What Your Goal Is</strong></h3>
As in, tell your readers the goal of this webpage. What is the story behind how this got started. Think about this part of the <em>About Me</em> page as the most recent part of <em>YOUR </em>story. Whatever the reason or topic of your blog or business, there is a route you took to get to that point. So, fill us in.

Bring us up to speed with things like what brought you to this launch. Answer questions that readers have, because they have lots of questions. Otherwise, there would be no need for you to be online answering them. Figure out a way to explain the issue or problem your business aims to solve for people.

How can your blog help its readers or customers? This simple question can fill out page after page on a blog. The purpose that your blog has is significant. It shapes where the blog will grow to and where its humble beginnings started. I am sorry to say, but if you have not figured out a "problem" to address or help people with, then you will fail. Be a person of value, and your success will follow naturally.
<h3><strong>4. How Should We Reach You?</strong></h3>
This, I recommend being at the bottom near a Call-To-Action of sorts. There are lots of contact methods available but social media links are your "money makers". In today's online centered world if you don't have a social media presence, you are wrong.

Just like you add and build your following for your blog, build on social media as well. Having these extra channels for your readers to access you through, makes you accessible. For readers that have specific questions, request etc., you should give them a way to get in touch with you.

If you have not set up a domain specific email address, set one up. Once that is done, include it in the list of contact methods. In total, make sure to include the following:
<ul>
 	<li><img class="alignleft wp-image-446" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/can-you-hear-me-now.jpg" alt="about me page contacting me" width="490" height="265" />Email (domain specific or DOMAIN@gmail.com)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Social Media Links (Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Other sites you own (if relevant)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Phone number (if you take clients personally)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Link to website contact form (if you have one)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5. Recommended Readings</strong></h3>
I know I said I'm not going to assume, but I will break that rule here. I ASSUME, that you as a website owner would prefer people stay on your site past your <em>About Me</em> page. Crazy, I know. But, it's obviously important to keep your readers present on the site for as long as possible. If Google sees people spending lots of time at your site, it thinks you must have valuable material.

This is a concept to master. Making sure you can insert natural looking links into your posts at the right time is invaluable. Having other posts to link to is a part of this. So, write a couple quality posts and link to them from your <em>About Me</em> page. These can be posts about whatever your site is about. Think of them as your recommended reading for newcomers to your site.

For Example:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You own a site that is all about building muscle and fitness techniques. I would write a post about exercises for beginners. Then I would write one post about nutrition for beginners. Both for beginners. I say this because experts in fitness typically don't require knowledge on their craft from blogs. They are out in a gym. The newbie who doesn't have the confidence yet is who your audience would be. So cater to them and link to relevant posts to help them get started.</p>
Giving your readers a place to go to learn more from you, gives them a reason to stick around and listen to you run your suck all day. You will have better bounce rates and be able to attract more visitors and returning visitors.
<h3><strong>6. Create Your Call-To-Action</strong></h3>
So you have gone through and touched up your <em>About Me</em> page. You have introduced yourself and your business to the world, and given readers a way to contact you. There are pictures to attach a real person to the persona of the business. You have given readers a place to go from here and explore your site.

Now it is time to create what is known as a Call-To-Action. This can be several things. You could use this as a chance to promote a product of yours or maybe a course your created. It is a perfect time to request they leave information and subscribe to your site or newsletter.

A Call-To-Action is simply put, a way to get people to promote or build your business. It is not phrased that way, but essentially, you are asking for your readers to "<em>invest</em>" in you in some shape or form. This can be social promotion, or purchasing goods and services from you.

If you don't have a product or service available yet, don't worry. You can ask for shares and likes on social media instead. Being able to have a steady list of readers and followers online will make initial product launching infinitely smoother.
<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
By now, your <em>About Me</em> page should be looking fantastic. If you implemented the techniques in this article, you should have a well put together and engaging page all about you and your business.

This foundation will allow you to grow and create a following of trusting readers, willing to purchase what you recommend and promote. None of these perks are instant though. Nothing online happens overnight. No blogs will go from 0 readers to 100K readers because of an <em>About Me</em> page. But having the framework done...and done right, will let you grow bigger than without.

The foundations to success are the small things in your journey. Don't sweat the small stuff, but don't overlook it either.
