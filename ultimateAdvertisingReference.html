<h2>Understanding How To Advertise On Your Website</h2>

<hr />

The ability to effectively advertise on your website is key for any business or venture with an online presence. Which should be all of you. It's simple really. People should know about your idea and your business. If they don't it is going to be damn hard to make any money. Traversing the cluttered and confusing world of advertising can be quite the headache. Mainly because of all the terms and acronyms that mean nothing to a newbie.

Trying to read how-to articles for how to advertise on your website is confusing already. But it is overwhelming, if you understand none of what is being told to you. For that reason, I have put together this A to Z glossary for all the terms that confused me when I began learning how to advertise. This should (hopefully) cover anything you may encounter when learning how to advertise on your website. So without further adeaux...   <img class="wp-image-473 alignnone" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/advertising-150x150.jpg" alt="advertise on your website" width="258" height="258" />
<h1><strong>Advertise On Your Website - All the stuff ya gotta know first...</strong></h1>

<hr />

<h4><strong>A-</strong></h4>
<em>Ad Blocking</em> -
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is when web advertisements are being blocked. Typically, these are the images in a graphic ad or banner ad</p>
<em>Advertising Network</em> -
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Think Google Adsense. Essentially this is a company that represents a lot of websites and sell advertising. This allows companies to reach potential customers through your website. As an advertiser you should have these companies put your ads on other sites to help gain visitors.</p>
<em>Advertising Unit - </em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is just the actual ad that is placed on your site. Each one is called a unit.</p>


<hr />

<h4><strong>B- </strong></h4>
<em>Banner Ad - </em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is a graphic advertising unit typically a rectangle shape. Hint, hint...it looks like a banner. Like this ⇓⇓⇓</p>

<em>Banner Blindness - </em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The conditional blindness that your readers get when they ignore the banners in your articles. Like when you ignored the ad above and continued reading this post =D This is true though, even when the ads are relevant. Sometimes, people just don't care to see the ad. You can't get around that. So don't worry about making everyone happy.</p>
"Beyond-the-Banner" Advertising -
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is online advertising for your business, that does not make use of graphic ads. This can be other call to actions on social media. An opt-in form for email and newsletter. Possibly a landing page for a product you have created. Get creative. Graphic ads are not the end all be all. You should use several types of advertising on your site. Check out <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/theloopyproducer">The Loopy Producer</a></strong> on Facebook, for an example of a call to action.</p>

<h6><em>Bounce Rate - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This measurement is the percentage of visitors that leave your website after viewing only one page. Bounce rate is important...but not that important. So don't sweat it if you have a high bounce rate. Average overall, is somewhere between 41-55%. However, this heavily depends on the type of site you have. Bounce rates are high for coupon type sites and referral sites, due to their design of a quick stop website. For a blog or content site? You should shoot for between 26-40%.</p>
<em>Button Ad - </em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Same concept as a banner ad but...shocker, looks like a button not a banner. Typically smaller maybe round. Like this ⇓⇓⇓</p>
<a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=NYusHV8LgpA&amp;offerid=367009.31&amp;subid=0&amp;type=4"><img class="alignleft" src="https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=NYusHV8LgpA&amp;bids=367009.31&amp;subid=0&amp;type=4&amp;gridnum=6" alt="Fiverr" border="0" /></a>

<h4><strong>C-</strong></h4>
<h6><em>Cache/Caching - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is in the most simple sense, the storage of files online for later use. Your images and graphics will load much faster for your end user if your cache your files beforehand.</p>

<h6><em>Click-Through -</em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is what it is called when a visitor to your webpage clicks on an advertisement,and follows the link to the advertisers site. You should aim to have as many click-throughs as possible.</p>

<h6><em>Click-Through-Rate (CTR) -</em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is the average number of click-throughs per every 100 times the ad was shown to a visitor. Usually, this is shown as a percentage. This is a VERY important number to note. This will dictate part of your plan for advertising.</p>

<h6><em>Contextual Advertising - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is a method of advertising where the ad units are embedded into the content of the website. Think those ads that open in an article when your mouse rolls over a word. You should use embedded affiliate links as contextual advertising.</p>

<h6><em>Conversion Rate - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You should actively push to have a higher conversion rate each and every month. The conversion rate is the percentage of readers that take the advertiser up on their offer. Make sure you have relevant ads to your content. That way, your readers are more likely to take the action you want.</p>

<h6><em>Cookie - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Everyone loves cookies. Especially website owners and affiliate marketers. Your computer stores information from websites you visit. The information stored is your affiliate tracking information. Typically, these are saved on the readers computer for a predetermined amount of time.</p>

<h6><em>Cost Per Action (CPA) - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">CPA is an online payment method for advertising. This is only paid when specific actions are taken and are for a predetermined amount. The amount may fluctuate with the popularity and demand of the keywords associated to the ad.</p>

<h6><em>Cost Per Click (CPC) - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Similar to CPC but instead of paying for actions post click, you pay every time a reader clicks this ad.</p>

<h6><em>Cost Per Lead (CPL) - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">See a pattern yet? CPL, like the previous two, is a payment method for advertising. You are charged a fee every time a new qualified lead is generated.</p>

<h6>Cost Per Mile (CPM) -</h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is a fee you are charged for every 1000 impressions made.</p>

<h6><em>Customer Acquisition Cost - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is the calculated and planned cost for the work needed to acquire one new customer. You should take note of this cost for budgeting purposes.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>This is a really boring article...I apologize. Here is a cartoon to cheer up the mood.<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-481" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/722px-Successful_business.jpg" alt="advertise on your website" width="573" height="476" /></em></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>Okay...Now back to it.</em></h4>
<h4><strong>F- </strong></h4>
<h6><em>Frequency Cap - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You are able to set a restriction on the amount of times any one visitor sees the same ad. You should use this filter, to avoid annoying readers with repetitive ads. So, help your readers out, and implement a frequency cap for your returning visitors.</p>

<h4><strong>H-</strong></h4>
<h6><em>House Ad - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">House ads are self promotion that you run on your website. You should use house ads to promote inventory or special deals on your products, courses, etc.</p>

<h6><em>HTML Banner</em> -</h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Banners can be created in either JavaScript or HTML5. Simply put, HTML banners are banners written in HTML5 coding language. HTML banners are common with advertisements that request some kind of input from the reader past clicking. So, think opt-in banner ads that request email addresses.</p>

<h6><em>Hybrid Model - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When possible, you should utilize hybrid models for paying for advertisements. A hybrid model is a combination of two or more methods of advertisement payments. So, think a mixture of CPM and CPC.</p>

<h4><strong>I- </strong></h4>
<h6><em>Impression - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So, by now I have used this word a few times. All an impression is is anytime a advertisement was shown to a reader or visitor of your site. That's it.</p>

<h6><em>Interstitial - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you have ever been on Forbes website then you have seen this type of advertisement. Interstitial ads are the advertisements the show up between content pages. Typically, these ads fill the entire webpage and need to be exited out of to get to the rest of the content.</p>

<h4><strong>K-</strong></h4>
<h6><em>Keyword - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I hope you know what a keyword is. It's in the name.</p>

<h6><em>Keyword Marketing - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Keyword marketing is central to successful advertising campaigns. Without proper keyword marketing, you will not achieve any audience to read your ads. How do you optimize your keyword marketing? Well, you do that through...</p>

<h6><em>Keyword Research - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Keyword research is the grunt work of your advertising campaigning. You need to do significant research on the keywords you are using. So, doing this properly can be a bit confusing. You need to analyze which keywords will have a relatively high search volume with low competition. I will explain much more about this concept in further articles.</p>

<h4><strong>P-</strong></h4>
<h6><em>Pay Per Click (PPC) - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Unlike CPC marketing, PPC campaigns pay you each time your visitor clicks the banner or link. Have you ever used Google Adsense? If you have then you have used PPC marketing.</p>

<h6><em>Pay Per Lead (PPL) -</em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Common theme again. PPL marketing is the opposite of CPL. For example, if you have seen any free referral programs, you have seen PPL marketing. Whenever your reader becomes a lead you make a certain amount.</p>

<h6><em>Pay Per Sale (PPS) - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> So, PPS is the strictest of payment policies out of these methods. This is because in order to receive payment a sale must be made from clicking that ad. For example, if you have an advertisement for a product of yours you will only get money if you make a sale through it.</p>

<h4><strong>S-</strong></h4>
<h6><em>Search Retargeting - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Search retargeting is a method for advertisers that targets site visitor search history. The algorithms then use this as a basis for deciding which ads that visitor will see. Think about surfing the web. When you are on a blog and there is an advertisement for something you googled earlier that week...that is search retargeting.</p>

<h6><em>Sponsorship - </em></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This should be the goal of any website owner who relies on the success of their ad campaigns for income. Sponsorship's happen when advertiser and publisher seek to deepen integration to develop personalized plans. These often involve beyond-the-banner forms of advertising.</p>
