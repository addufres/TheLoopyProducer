<h2>Success Quote of the Day - March 2, 2017</h2>
<h5><em>"Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach."</em> <em>- Tony Robbins</em></h5>
Your "success quote of the day", today, is brought by Tony Robbins. Tony Robbins is a man synonymous with the word success. The thought of Tony Robbins brings images of giant seminars, motivational coaching and success stories. However, some say his charm is so infectious it's like being part of a cult. I think in some ways they are similar. The main difference is that Tony Robbins' followers are actively building better versions of their lives. This man is one that I try and emulate in my life. His success, his drive and confidence are forces to be reckoned with. He lives each word he preaches and has inspired millions around the world to do the same.

<h3><strong>What does this Success Quote mean?</strong></h3>
This quote is rooted in the methodology used to set your goals. Therefore, I will break this quote down using the S.M.A.R.T. system I break down<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/setting-goals-smart-system">HERE</a></span></strong>. With that method the "<strong>R</strong>" stands for relevant and realistic. Relevancy within your goals requires consistent updating to your goals.

"Staying committed", the first part of this quote, references to keeping the end goals the same no matter the hardships and struggles faced along the journey. In that regard, I emphasize perseverance. Sometimes, things just don't go our way. When these times are upon us remember the "vision".

"Stay flexible", the remainder of the quote, references how to handle those struggles and obstacles along the way. Just because you are committed to completion of a certain goal, you are not required to be stubborn with the route you take. If one action doesn't produce the desired outcome, step back. Step back and reevaluate the current path. Maybe it's time to reform the steps needed to reach completion of your goal. This does not affect the time frame or any other aspects of the end result. This just makes the journey more favorable to success.
<h3><strong>How have I applied this Success Quote in my life?</strong></h3>
In my life I have worked towards and achieved many large goals. I will focus this bit on a goal I am currently working towards. I have the goal to have a motivation and success coaching business. With this goal, my path will and has changed several times. My goal of having that business for myself has never changed, though the steps I take to achieve it have.

For example, when I first completed my contract of enlistment I decided that the best way to have this goal completed would be to go through traditional college and a 4-year university and get a degree in Business. However, that soon changed when I learned I would spend two year learning irrelevant information, thus pushing my goal back further. So, I ended that and instead opened an insurance agency with Farmers Insurance. This was a stepping stone I used to gather knowledge and skills for how to operate a business. This included business plans, client acquisition, marketing and advertisement. In doing this I also learned that I <em>do not like talking insurance</em> for hours a day.
<h5><em>It was time for a change...</em></h5>
Having gained the necessary skill I set out to learn, I moved course in my life and moved to Denver, CO to pursue my final goal and utilize the GI Bill for supplemental income in the mean time. However, since the move I have developed my platform and launched my brand as The Loopy Producer. This namesake is double sided. The Loopy Producer is meant to symbolize my passion for music and my passion for producing results with my clients.

I am sure that before long my method will change again to adapt to the environment I am in. My growth towards my goal, though, will never change and I will continue to grow each and every day. All to become the man I hope to be for this world.

To all of your continued and eventual success!
