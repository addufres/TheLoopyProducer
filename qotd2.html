Michael Scott. The Man. The Myth. The Legend. The Quote Of The Day today encircles the manager from my personal favorite TV show of all time The Office. Michael Scott is known for his unorthodox and somewhat questionable methods for running the Scranton, PA branch of Dunder-Mifflin Paper.

His charisma and charm won the hearts of millions of viewers around the world. But, it was his insight into life and his tenacity for creating a happy view of life that got me hooked. Though this quote is actually a Wayne Gretzky quote, Michael Scott quoted him for the lesson of going for goals regardless of possible outcome.

This quote was written on a whiteboard in the office Michael used to start his own paper company in the middle of the series. His dedication to following his heart and taking every opportunity he could, shows the kind of character qualities I strive to emulate in my day to day life.
<h3>So What Does This Mean?</h3>
It means take the chance on yourself. Follow where your heart and brain lead you. Take those shots even if you end up smacking the boards and not the net. By simply taking action you are inherently closer than had you stayed put.

If we look at this from the perspective of hockey, we see that even though each shot may not make it on goal, we make it closer to the goal with each shot. If I "shoot the puck" at the goal then regardless of whether I make my target or not I am on the right side of the rink now.

So take each shot. Even if you will probably miss. The next shot you take will be from so much closer, the chances of success are exponentially larger.
<h3>Michael Scott Lessons On Living Full</h3>
Michael Scott has somewhat of a blissful ignorance when it comes to living in "real life". His special way of seeing the world though, gives him the unique ability to handle adversity with a smile on his face. We see throughout the series how Michael is able to push through seemingly insurmountable odds only to come out successful on the other side.

Think about his love life. He gave everything he had in him to each and every relationship. Though none before Holly worked for him, each one brought him closer to meeting Holly. His choices and actions dictated what opportunities were available to him later in the show.

Think about that as your life now. When you take chances, take chances that bring you closer to your goal. There is a distinct difference between missing opportunities and taking frivolous opportunities to appear busy.

Yes you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. However, not all shots are worth taking. If you want to have a million dollars in the bank, it makes sense to invest money. Two opportunities present themselves:
<ol>
 	<li>A start up tech company with great projections and data to back everything up.</li>
 	<li>Your buddy who says he <em>totally can turn 1 grand into 1 million in like a month bro</em></li>
</ol>
Both of these are opportunities to shoot and score. However, one of these based on the info provided is not worth the shot. You are going to accrue a certain amount of risk regardless with this, but choosing a well founded investment would be much smarter than trusting an uneducated friend(or email chain letter).

With the former there is a good chance of a positive outcome. With the latter there is a good chance of hurt feelings and a pissed off accountant.
<h3>Be Happy With Your Choices</h3>
Make good thought out choices and you will make more shots. Take the time to look into what opportunities are available and you will make sure you never miss an important one again!
