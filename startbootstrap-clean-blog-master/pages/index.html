              <p>From industry leading programs like Ableton and Fruity Loops, writers block tips and tricks, and hardware essentials it is
                 or will be covered here. I am here to give my best advice on how to keep moving forward even if you have no clue what you are doing!
              </p>
              <p>From complete beginners on a budget to seasoned vets who are hitting a roadblock, what we do is aim to help each and every one of my 
                readers in some form.
              </p>
              <p>Therefore, I have used each program and piece of equipment I review. In addition, I will discuss ways to get the creative juices 
                flowing. Beginners will benefit from what we do in our guide to building a home studio. For me, if the first step wasn't the hardest, 
                then the second to last one was. I had so much trouble figuring out the last bit to "complete" my piece. Now that I have analyzed and 
                sorted out easy to follow methods, I am ready to share them with anyone who needs a fresh perspective or a new idea.
              </p>
              <em>It comes from trial and error...mostly error.</em>
              <p>In addition to information and tricks for music production, I am also dedicated to bringing the best ways for you to make money online
                 funding your passions. Basic website setup to tips on how to make money with it, and everything in between will be covered in our
                  business development page.
              </p>
              <p>I have always felt that the best way to be happy and successful in life is to own something you can call your own. Something you can 
                grow and develop and give to the world. For me, The Loopy Producer, is one of these things. I have been in sales and marketing for years 
                and have developed and learned an abundance of tools and methods.
              </p>
              <p><em><strong>THESE ARE NOT GET RICH QUICK OR MLM.</strong></em>These are articles and tools designed solely to educate. I hope to allow 
                you to develop a business that can fund your passions and actually make money. The music industry is expensive, and I know how daunting 
                it seems to the budget conscious. I feel it was only fair to teach you how to earn money through a brand of your own. Making money with 
                affiliate marketing can be a viable source of additional income each month.
              </p>
              <p>So take a look around! Afterwards, make sure to subscribe to our newsletter to get monthly tips and tricks directly to your inbox.</p>
              <p>Thankfully, as this site grows and gains new content, it will clean up significantly. Enjoy!</p>
