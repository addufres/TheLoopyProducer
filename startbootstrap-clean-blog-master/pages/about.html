          <p>Other than cars, music I would say is my oldest love. One that began when I was maybe 4-5. I just had music in my head that I wanted to get
            out but never knew how. Learning to play instruments at a young age, I began with piano and trumpet in elementary school. The latter of which I played through high school. My issue was always that I never knew how to get past "producers block", so to speak, or even where to start with computer music production, let alone compose entire songs on my own.
            <h3><em><strong>That is why I created this site...at first.<img class="wp-image-132 alignright" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0582-e1487406780419-200x300.jpg" width="178" height="267" /></strong></em></h3>
             I searched for years talking with musicians who had been classically trained and were not adept to the practices of MIDI or computer based music production. I read online forums and took courses and bought instruction books left and right. Over time, I put together a tidbit here and a snippet there, and I noticed I had something. I had the complete picture. How to get quality equipment cheap, how to create and apply the sound I desired, and most importantly how to get past that damn "producers block".
          </p>

          <p>It wasn't until I enlisted and broadened my circle of influence, that I began dabbling in computer based music production. Once I got past the initial learning curve, I realized the sheer breadth of possibilities to create with this new tool I had learned. To me this was a turning point. I read everything I could get my hands on about chord theory and song structure. Once I bought the basic equipment to get going, I was off.
            <h3><strong><em>I never looked back...</em></strong></h3>
            Because I made that choice I have grown as a musician. Stepping into the hip-hop scene and learning how to take feedback like, "it should, you know sound deeper" and interpret what the listener wanted has given me an ability to break down the complexities of music production and reformat them so a beginner or expert in production can benefit. This coupled with my natural aptitude for marketing and sales, I have put together a one stop shop, per say, for everything music and money making.
          </p>

          <p>Around the same time I became enthralled with making a legacy for myself and creating something I can be both proud and profiting from. Something I could take and pass on or give back to the people that made me into the man I am today. I since then have learned how to brand myself. Developing skills in marketing and sales. Being that the internet is the place to be for small business I chose to base my brands online primarily.
            <h3><em><strong>So how to pay it forward...</strong></em></h3>
            I have been in internet marketing for several years now and have amassed enough information to start bringing it to you, my readers. After all, my end goal is to be a success coach, helping millions around the world achieve success and reach a point of fulfillment in their life. If I can help you with tips and tools for that, I can make a difference. The other half is teaching you how to brand yourself, so that you are able to use your passion of whatever as income that you are as proud of as your creations.
          </p>

          <p>I created this site for you, the passionate beginner and seasoned but struggling entrepreneur alike. I hope that everyone can find something relevant, informative and entertaining on this site. If just one person out of all 2 billion online learns something and makes money from their passion then I call this a success.
