            <p>Welcome back to part two of my introductory article on music equipment reviews for building a home studio. 
              This is for any home producer looking to get started or cut costs and build a budget minded music production 
              studio at home. In Part 1 I discussed the recommended method to save money doing what you love, while still 
              giving yourself a way to master your tracks and productions.
            </p>

            <p>If you have not read Part 1, click<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="LINK TO PART ONE" target="_blank">--HERE--</a> 
                </span></strong>now. I recommend doing so, as it is a fantastic foundation and a great starting point for any musician looking to compose 
                music and produce mastered tracks for cheap.
            </p>

            <p>And if you have not gone and followed us on Facebook you can do that <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" 
                href="https://www.facebook.com/theloopyproducer" target="_blank">--&gt;HERE&lt;--</a></span></strong> If you like what you see here make sure to share on 
                social media down at the bottom and leave comments with questions or discussion topics below.
            </p>
            <p>This next part is in my opinion the core aspect of any home music studio and the main component to allowing you to make money at home doing 
              what you love. I am referring to the main software suite and MIDI or other hardware controller used to actually create your music from the 
              comfort of your bedroom. I began with this program almost half a decade ago. When I bought it, I was also brand new to making music from home.

            <h2 class="section-heading">WORKFLOW, WORKFLOW, WORKFLOW></h2>
            <p>I can't stress it enough. The ability to optimize your workflow will allow you to focus more on creation instead of setting up and resetting
               up. The Maschine MKII by Native Instruments, is to me the best option to purchase for any level of expertise. The Native Instruments Maschine 
               has the ability to do absolutely whatever you want it to, but it is simple and straightforward enough for even the newest of music producers.

            <p>The Native Instruments Maschine controller is a fully compatible as a MIDI controller for any program that allows you to custom map a controller 
              for external use. That means that even though the Maschine software is more than enough to accomplish anything you want with music production, it 
              is versatile enough to serve you throughout whatever programs you use additionally down the road.

            <p>As a stand-alone program for audio production Maschine does just that. It holds its own against the likes of industry giants like

                (<em>the creators of FL Studio)</em>. It comes out of the box with the industry leading synthesizer plug-in Massive. This alone is a few 
                hundred dollar plug-in on its own.
            </p>
            <p>It comes with a digital sound library over 22GB large! Included in this bundle is every possible sound or sample you can need to make countless 
              albums. The added ability to alter each individual sound makes it so that realistically you could never spend a cent on sound libraries again.

            <p>I am and have been a huge fan of the capabilities the Maschine has. It was the first controller I invested in and was the best choice I made 
              financially when starting out as a music producer. I love the ease of ability to slice samples and create entirely new productions in half the
               time.
