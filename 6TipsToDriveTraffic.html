So now what? If you are at all similar to me, now that you have a website you are asking yourself this same question. First off, welcome to the internet. It is a huge step deciding to start a business online. Whether it is for professional or personal reasons, putting your life online can be overwhelming.

Getting people to find it and read your work is even harder. I totally understand the plight of the new internet marketer. This landscape is filled with sharks and titans. What most people don't understand is that you can make a very comfortable living online without being a multi-millionaire blogger. I know several hundred entrepreneurs that make maybe 5k a month online but are totally free and happy to do as they please.

However, no money will be made if you don't learn how to drive traffic to your website. A personal friend wrote a great blog entry about the growth and flow of traffic. I suggest you <strong><a href="https://my.wealthyaffiliate.com/kyle/blog/website-traffic-is-like-a-mountain-stream-and-river/a_aid/0337277e">check that out</a></strong> before reading the rest of this, as it will put everything I say here in perspective.

Without wasting anymore time, here are The Loopy Producers'
<h3 style="text-align: center;">6 TIPS To Drive Traffic To Your Brand (Spanking) New Blog</h3>

<hr />

<h5>1. Meet your new coworkers!</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As is customary in any industry, introduce yourself. Make an obvious effort to connect and introduce yourself to other successful internet bloggers and marketers. By keeping in touch you will give yourself the ability to remain both relevant and known about. Who knows you may get a feature or backlink!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>How do you do this?</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Easy, it takes four consistent things. First off, make sure that you are engaging on their websites. Leave insightful and discussion inducing comments on their articles. You will be surprised how often you will get contacted back just by leaving a good quality comments and feedback. Second, building on comments, read the comments of others. Finding a comment of someone else's that you can help with is invaluable to them finding your site next. Think about it. You go to a website and leave a comment asking a question. Then, someone else comments back helping you out and happens to have a website of their own. My next move would be to go there and see what else they have to offer me for advice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>"Helping others will almost always help you out in the long run." - The Loopy Producer</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Third, make sure you are sharing these posts and your posts on different communities and blogs. Sharing your posts will require some other work so you don't come across as spam, doable but not super simple. Sharing their posts however and adding value in the status line, can and will increase your viewings. By linking to already reputable sites that have similar information, you are inviting people to read your content. Why? Because as a reader, it is normal to assume that one post shared on a website will be relevant to the rest of the website.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fourth, and finally, be a friend. Be nice and be personable. You will thank yourself later...you can thank me too if you so desire =D When your friend is raving about how amazing something is, you are more than likely going to at least give it a glance. The same principle applies to the internet. When people perceive you as a friend, they trust what you have to say. So, don't abuse that trust and give them quality information to read up on. Being a friend to your readers will help build communication and trust between y'all.</p>


<hr />

<h5>2. Create. Quality. Content.</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">These three words will shape the entirety of what your blog becomes. This can be overwhelming in the beginning. I get it. Everyone hears "create content" and starts running for the hills. The thing is, if you write from the heart and are passionate about what you write about, people will pick up on that. Quality content is content written from the heart. Creating quality content is not difficult and if you incorporate these four strategies I guarantee your content will be top notch.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><img class="wp-image-528 alignright" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/people-office-group-team.jpg" alt="driving traffic building relationships" width="363" height="241" />Quality</strong> - Making your content with quality is a simple as filling it with all the information you would want if you were the reader. Making it rich with the topic is an easy way to portray quality. Adding pictures keeps the flow of the article nice and adds to the quality of it. Take a look at some competitor blogs to see what that entails for your niche specifically.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Focus</strong> - Staying focused throughout an article and not jumping from topic to topic is important to creating quality content. When writing your article, take the perspective of the reader. Talk to the reader and answer questions you think they may have. What is the problem you are solving with this post? Focus on that and the rest follows naturally.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Consistency</strong> - Create some kind of posting schedule for yourself. A quality blog will have new content added on a regular basis. This does not always mean post things every day all day. If you do that (especially as a new blogger) you will burn yourself out fast. Instead, pick a couple post categories and consistently fill those out. Here at The Loopy Producer, I add one new success quote of the day each day. This gives me consistency and value relevant to my site as a whole. This feed gives readers a good starting point and way to travel throughout the site finding new and interesting posts. <strong><a href="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/category/motivation/success-quote-of-the-day/">Check them out here</a></strong>!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Promote Results</strong> - Your posts should involve some kind of actionable technique that readers can use to see results from your advice quickly. This DOES NOT mean promise results you cannot backup. This does mean create tips and tricks that readers can go implement quickly. This article is an example of that. Another example would be my <strong><a href="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/6-tips-for-awesome-about-me-page/">6 Tips for About Me </a></strong>pages.</p>

<h5>3. Get some subscribers!</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Everyone has been told that, "you need an email list to succeed online". That is true in every sense. The problem is you need traffic to get subscribers. Therefore, this tip is meant to be implemented as you are able to. Being able to have a list of subscribers on hand who want to hear what you have to say will make sales conversions and general traffic increase ten fold.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But how do you get the subscribers in the first place?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Value</strong> - Create value and incentivize your readers into subscribing. Here at The Loopy Producer, at the time of this writing, I am hard at work creating an ebook to give away as a freebie for newsletter subscribers. The idea behind this concept is that people like free stuff. Correction...they LOVE free stuff. Don't worry about making this product the best damn product you have ever made. Because, in reality, it is most likely the first product you have ever made. It most likely will reflect that in some way. Be confident and give it away for free. Stay tuned for The Loopy Producer freebie.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Strategize</strong> - Experiment and play around with placement and visuals. Creating a sign up form and placing it where readers are looking is crucial to signups. Some people opt for a banner on the top that is there regardless of what else the reader is viewing. I personally find this annoying, so I chose to include a sign-up form on the top of the sidebar. If you haven't already go subscribe to The Loopy Producer and stay up to date with the best tips and tricks for funding your passions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Be Kind</strong> - Write your newsletters like a friend writing to a friend. Be kind, warm, sincere. You should use these newsletters as quick check ups and updates for your readers. Any new products or posts make good topics in a newsletter. Don't sell in these necessarily, but nudge people back to your site to read and purchase as they so choose. People hate being sold, but they love buying things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Autoresponders</strong> - These are a bloggers best friend for managing large or growing email lists. I use MailChimp (not affiliated) personally, for my autoresponder. The free version allows me to create simple opt-in forms and contact pages. In addition, having an autoresponder will give you the ability to pre-arrange all newsletters, sales pitches, redirects, etc. Having this done out of mind out of sight let you work on building the list instead of tending to it. Letting you get back to writing awesome posts to attract new readers.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-529" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/icon-2087419_960_720.png" alt="driving traffic email subscribes" width="514" height="257" /></p>


<hr />

<h5>4. Write guest posts (on the right blogs)</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So you write on your blog all the time, but no one reads it. Not because its bad, but because they have no way of knowing about you. Get around that by posting on other blogs as a guest writer. Finding other blogs with a solid readership and subscriber list is the first step. Being able to reach out and request a guest posting comes next.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Research</strong> - Before you attempt this you should have a good amount of content on your site. (20-30 posts) Why? Because you are essentially interviewing for a position as a writer for another blog. Any well respected blogger will do his homework before granting your request to write for them. Go through the target blog and site and review their writing style. How are their posts formatted? Answering these questions before you apply will give you the best chance of success. You will most likely be asked for several drafts for them to pick from. Having these drafts already in the writing style and formatting of the site will increase your chances of being able to actually write for them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Share</strong> - This one is simple. Once you have been given the job to write the post. Write it. Write it damn well, and then share the heck out of it. Doing this will bring exposure to your writings and in turn to your blog.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Topic</strong> - The topic of the guest post you write will heavily dictate how their audience will grasp it. Will they love it? Or, will they wonder who the heck you are and what the heck are you talking about. To fix or avoid this issue all together, go ahead and find their most successful posts. Pick these topics as the general topic for your guest article. By writing to appease the readers you are much more likely to have your post both seen and shared many more times.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Backlinks</strong> - Ahh...backlinks. The elusive aspect of the internet. How do you get your website linked to on "authority" sites and blog pages. Luckily for you, having a spot as a guest writer gives you the chance to implement backlinks to your site. How you ask? Through the articles you write for others. You should add links to other relevant posts on your own site in this article. This will introduce the readers of the guest post blog to your blog.</p>


<hr />

<h5>5. Writing traffic inducing posts</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Similar to writing posts on other sites, the articles on your website should have the elements of traffic creation. Get creative, and use methods found in other sections to make your own posts stir traffic.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-530" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pexels-photo-332787-e1489293802315.jpeg" alt="driving traffic green light" width="364" height="627" />Top 5 Lists</strong> - Create blog posts linking to and talking about your most influential posts. These are articles you have read that have helped you along the way. Link to influencers and other sites in your niche. The sharing of traffic helps create the sense of authority within your niche.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Review</strong> - People want to buy things. Plain and simple. They like spending the money they have. Before they do, however, they typically do some research on that product or service. Be their review. Creating good in depth reviews on products in your niche will give people a reason to come to your site. The more reviews, the more reasons people have to read your work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Interview</strong> - Interview other success stories. Bring to light the ways  that successful people have reached success in your niche. Being able to have contact with "influencers", will grow your perceived worth and give people more reason to trust your advice. Interviewing others on your site also shows you are involved in the community. Being involved in your niche's community online will create the atmosphere of an authority figure for your own blog.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Co-authorship</strong> - Similar to guest posting on other blogs, have authority bloggers co-author or guest post on your blog. These posts will drive massive traffic on their own. This is because the following the guest poster has will naturally follow them to your sight to read their article there. If you have other relevant articles (as you should), then giving readers a path to follow will help them to see the other value your site has.</p>

<h5>6. Curiosity may have killed the cat but it will make your blog famous!</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Make people think with your postings. The titles should create intrigue, making your readers wonder what else could be in that article. Ask questions, create a mystique around the articles you are marketing for. Giving your readers a sense of curiosity will make them much more likely to click the link and read what's in store for them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Story Time</strong> - Begin your articles with a story to draw in your readers. This can be an example story, an excerpt from another post, or a personal tale pertaining to the topic at hand. Giving your work an air of storytelling makes for great writing. It helps the articles flow between topics and headlines.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Keep 'em Curious</strong> - Try not to give away all the goodies in the title and first paragraph. Don't hop right into it. If I had started this article with, "Here are 6 ways to drive traffic to your blog", and then immediately listed all six things, there is a good chance you would not be reading this part at the bottom. Give an overview but don't give away the meat of the article in the beginning. Give your readers a reason to keep reading.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>It's in the Title</strong> - Create titles that draw in your readers with a sense of urgency. "Top 5 ways to..." and "3 Best Methods for..." work great as templates for how to write blog titles. The title you choose is the deciding factor in whether your readers click or skip. So take your time coming up with these. Check out my list of<strong><a href="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/200-awesome-eye-catching-blog-titles-to-get-people-reading/"> Awesome Eye Catching Blog Titles</a></strong> here.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Make it Urgent</strong> - Curiosity should be the drawing factor to get people to read your article. Making it urgent will help get them to take action afterwards. After all, the goal here is building traffic to get seen and read. If people see and read your blog they are more likely to purchase the goods and services you provide. Things like, "for a limited time only" or "Only for my subscribers if you..." work great as starting points.</p>
