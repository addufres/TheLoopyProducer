<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 Review</span></h2>
The Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 is a usb audio interface designed with simplicity and the end user in mind. It is also one of the most popular audio interfaces available today. 
As with most studio usb audio interfaces, this one allows you to plug in multiple inputs using either MIDI or traditional 1/4" plugs. It comes with a plugin suite as well.
 All of which I will go over throughout.

The two input design and budget conscious price of the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 makes this a perfect option for a home music producer with minimal need for a large number of inputs.

I bought the Scarlett 2i2 audio interface several years ago when the 1st generation model was still the current model. I still use it to this day and have never had any issue
 whatsoever with quality of outputs or any integration issues at all. In fact I use it as my main audio preamp for all speaker use at home.

<h5>Combatibility</h5>
Connecting to your computer through USB 2.0 the drivers installed with the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 are equipped to work with the most common Windows and Mac operating systems.
 According to Focusrite's website the drivers should work with operating systems for Windows as old as XP, however, they stated it had not been tested yet. Officially they 
 recommend using it with Windows 7 and up or Mac OSX 10.6.5 and up. Upon some curious research on forums I found users that claim to be successfully integrating the drivers 
 with Windows XP. I do not recommend this as I cannot verify or confound these stories.

</span>Scarlett 2i2 utilizes two combo-jacks with built in preamps. These jacks accept both XLR cables used commonly with microphones as well as 1/4" TRS cables used with line-in 
instruments and hardware. As is common in audio interfaces there is 48V phantom power that can be turned on and off through a button next to the master volume knob. On the Scarlett 
2i2, each input channel has a dedicated switch to identify the signal being given to the 2i2. These switches allow you to select which impedance level you want.
<ul>
 	<li>Lower impedance for microphones</li>
 	<li>Higher impedance for instruments like electric guitars which use pickups that require higher impedance to keep the high end frequencies in the signal clear.

</ul>
When using the Focusrite 2i2 input with line mode active, the internal preamps put out upt ot 29dB of gain. However, when switched to instrument mode the preamps up output to 46dB 
of gain, which is more than adequate for most applications. I have used this with both tradition instruments, keyboards, and microphones and have never once run into any output issues.

Each input jack is accompanied by a LED halo surrounding the channel gain knob. This changes from green to yellow, orange and then red when different levels are reached. The LED remains
 off until a signal over -24dB is found at which point it turns green. It turns orange once the signal nears 0 dB and red once the signal begins clipping.

</span> has a basic arrangment of outputs for an introductory or small studio set up. On the rear of the unit, there are two balanced 1/4" TRS jacks for connecting to studio monitors 
for playback. The volume for these is controlled through the large main knob on the front of the 2i2. In addition to monitoring there is a small switch beneath this knob that controls 
the hardware direct monitoring function.

Direct monitoring is very helpful when both recording and monitoring inputs without having to put any extra strain on the computer processor. This is especially handy when you are
 already using several plugins, which use up a significant amount of processing power. There is no way, however, to directly control the output level of direct monitoring past the 
 main volume knob. I personally haven't run into any issues where this has been a problem. This may mean having to turn down other monitoring channels to isolate the one that is being 
 used, and then when levels are good to go, re-balance all other channels. I can see where this may pose a problem but I have never had this issue. To each their own right?

There is independent volume control for the

1/4" headphone jack to the right of the main volume knob. This is controlled by a smaller knob above the jack point. Having the ability to independently control the headphone monitoring
 volume has been very helpful when bouncing between monitors and headphones to find and tweak specific sounds. The preamp is more than enough with the headphone jack as it is advertised 
 as 10Ω, while similarly priced competitors hover between 20-30Ω.
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em>In laymen terms, more resistance = less amperage for output i.e. softer sound</em></p>

     production studios and home based music producers. I am able to work effectively with the Scarlett 2i2 with the inputs available, however, I wish there were MIDI functionality included 
     with this device to use with keyboards and whatnot. The end user of the Scarlett 2i2 can rest assured it is quality built for long term use and overall durability. It comes with a 
     unibody brushed aluminum casing and solid feel knobs, buttons and switches.

The Scarlett 2i2 includes some software and various plugins as well. These add ons are a good basis to begin mixing and mastering tracks in your home studio. The plugins that the Scarlett 
2i2 comes with out of the box can be used with any audio software. This makes it very versatile for any home producer. I have used it with my Maschine for years and I highly recommend this
 as a starting point for your first home studio.
