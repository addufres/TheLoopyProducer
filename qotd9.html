Ralph Waldo Emerson was one of the earliest writers and thinkers on transcendentalism. His views and work have shaped the development of our understanding of this foreign idea. Ralph Waldo Emerson was a prolific writer, poet, and lecturer. Emerson has taught numerous people to shape their own lives through powerful thought control techniques. I personally have used the methods he writes about in his essay collections. I highly recommend Ralph Waldo Emerson's readings and essay collections. Check them out on amazon below.

<h3><strong>So what the heck does this mean?</strong></h3>

<hr />

This has less to do with success professionally, and instead focuses on becoming the best version of yourself. How? Through intensely honest self reflection. It is painful, at time, to take a hard look inside and dig deep. There are things that you will encounter, through introspective thought, that will shock you. You work through the crap and clean the inside of your mind. And then, you sort and dig and work on your image of yourself.

You are your greatest and worst critic. But, being able to do that for yourself is so important in happiness. You know what you have done. You know where you want to go from here. What you need to figure out is what you are capable of on the inside. For a vast majority of people, they don't know what they are able to push through.

By opening up the possibilities, you open up to new opportunities. The ability within the human mind to accomplish is astounding. The strength of the human spirit is unsurpassed, a thing of beauty. Start with your fears. Summon your fears and push through what you are afraid of. Breaking the barrier of fear and hesitation will clear your mind of clutter. The "what ifs" and the "I can'ts" will fall to the wayside and the confidence will begin to shine through.
<h3> <strong>But this sounds hard...</strong></h3>

<hr />

Yea...it is. Sorry, not sorry. Changing your thought paradigm and self perception is one of, if not the hardest thing you have ever done. Nothing comes easy in life if the payout is big enough. The greatest rewards in this world are reserved for those who persevere and remain steadfast in their commitment to becoming a better person. Remember, the worth of your mind is incomprehensible.

So get out, and go change something little. Prove to yourself that you have the ability to succeed inside you. Every step afterwards will get progressively easier. I promise. It won't be overnight or even a month. But a year later, two? Yes, you will undoubtedly notice a difference in your quality of life and general happiness. If you see no change, then I promise you it is solely due to your lack of effort. I'll say it. Most people are lazy. Many of you will probably read this, think "yea that's a great idea. I'm gonna do that", and never do another thing about it. Wonder why the world isn't filled with people living to their potential? Because it is not easy to be thought conscious and deliberate with your perception of the world.
