<h4>The First Step To Building a Home Studio For Under $1000</h4>

There are a few things that I require when making a recommendation about a pair of headphones. Especially those that are used to make music at home where who knows what kind of sound deadening there is available.
<ol>
 	<li>You will be wearing your studio headphones for long periods of time. This is especially true when you are on a roll with a piece and lose track of time. Therefore, they must have multiple reviews on Amazon for being comfortable and the build quality must be that of brand name and trusted manufacturers.</li>
 	<li>Your music will at some point need to pass the "car test", and more often than not if its good they turn it up. Well with low frequencies that are typically hit in the subwoofer range you need a pair of headphones that can also emulate those frequencies for when it comes time to master your track. My absolute highest I recommend going as far as low end capability for headphones is 20Hz.</li>
 	<li>Finally, the overall "crispness" of the sound. What I mean is there should be no deadening frequencies being played to induce a noise cancelling effect. This can ruin the mastering process and drive you mad, as you will be literally chasing down the sound of silence. I learned this the hard way when I first started producing I bought a pair of $200 Bose noise cancelling headphones.</li>
 	<li>The headphones need to retain a flat EQ curve for the listener. This means that no frequency ranges are louder than others. What this allows you to do is keep a good solid baseline throughout production, so when it comes time to master your levels are skewed from what your headphones are telling you they sound like.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Sony MDR-7506 Review</h3>
The studio headphones that I have chosen are a capstone product in the audio world. Popular with audio professionals in several industries for decades.

The Sony MDR-7506 is an excellent closed-ear, isolating professional audio headphone. The MDR-7506 is Amazons #1 selling professional recording headphone. In addition to being used in professional audio production studios, the MDR-7506 were designed with comfort and quality in mind so they work perfect for travel and long time periods of constant use.

These were used in most radio stations and productions studios since the late 1970's! The reason the MDR-7506 headphones are still popular today is because Sony built upon the already near perfect track record of the MDR-V6.

The best part? They are under $100.

However the true quality of sound comes when you plug the Sony MDR-7506 in for some audio mastering and production. These are designed for you to here whats <em>wrong </em>with your music, not what's right.

They excel well beyond their competition at any price when it comes to being able to find and correct small pops, crackles, and other unwanted noises that clutter a track and ruin a finished product. They have a equalized flat profile to allow you to fill in where is needed.

I owned these headphones for well over a year before buying a pair that cost twice as much...<em>and I wish I never had. </em>They are more comfortable and sound better than more expensive models like the <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B000ULAP4U/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487730570&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=audio+technica+athm50&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=theloopyprodu-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=8c41ca992613ec43f26f9abd70d497c1&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank">Audio Technica ATH-M50</a></span></strong><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theloopyprodu-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. Overall,<em> </em>I gained nothing from switching to a set double the cost. The sheer breadth of quality these sub-$100 pair of headphones is why they consistently rank number 1 and why they are my first recommendation for a new music producers studio collection.
