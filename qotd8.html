Sam Walton is the man whose vision and dream created one of the most successful store chains in the world. Wal-Mart. Even though, his vision has employed thousands of employees and given rise to a mountain of success for the Walton family. It is clear that his vision would have had no success had it not been for the team of people who helped build Wal-Mart into what it is today. Although, for all the good and bad that Wal-mart has, the success of the company has been built on the teamwork and environment they create. This Sam Walton quote is a simple and elegant demonstration.
<h3><strong>So what does this mean?</strong></h3>

<hr />

To me, this has a similar interpretation as the common phrase, "There is no I in team". Being able to recognize that your vision and hard work will only get you so far is crucial to true growth. However, being able to reach out and build a team will allow you to succeed much more than alone. No empire was built alone. No war is won without troops on the ground.

Developing your "dream team" should not be taken lightly. Take your time with these decisions. These are the people you are bringing to the top with you on your journey to success. Therefore, success is reached when the people you help reach their goals. You must build up your team or employees. Otherwise, you will be left with minimal output and a divided work force.

The secret to success is not going it alone. That is what this Sam Walton quote is saying.
<h3><strong>Everyone has a part in the success of a company.</strong></h3>

<hr />

Whether you are a large or small company...regardless of whether you are new or seasoned, having a hardworking and loyal team is crucial to success. Barney the purple dinosaur taught me as a kid that everybody does their share and everyone succeeds. And still, that holds just as true for adult life. Thats why, being able to work together with a group will make your success grow ten fold.

These team members operate in all aspects of a company. Some of the most helpful and critical parts of my organization are not done by myself. Therefore, the help I have received I consider to be part of my team. Helping others succeed helps me hone my craft. Working with others employees and customers will build you up.
