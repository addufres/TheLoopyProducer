<h2>Setting Goals and Achieving Success</h2>
Setting goals is the foundation to any successful endeavor. This doesn't matter if it is short term or long term. It makes no difference whether it is 
for personal or professional development. The method outlined here for setting goals is adopted from the S.M.A.R.T system of goal setting.

This method was taught to me by every mentor I have had throughout my life. This method allows for simple goal setting with measurable success.

<h4>S - Be SPECIFIC in your goals.</h4>
Stating exactly what you plan to achieve when writing your goals down. If possible, it may be necessary to break down a larger goal into smaller segments to be 
specific enough.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I.E. "Save $1000 dollars" should be broken down into specific steps and each one of those becomes a goal to build off of with the 
    rest of these steps. A first step to saving $1000 could be to "Identify spots in the current budget to lower payments each month"</p>

<h4>M - Make your goals MEASURABLE.</h4>

Establishing clear parameters to measure your progress when setting goals is extremely important for being able to maintain focus and determination towards 
completing your goals. As you get closer towards accomplishing goals you set you will be glad you have made it possible to track your progress.

Making your goals measurable, makes them attainable. Being able to set measurements regarding the progress of your goals is critical towards achieving success.
<h4>A - Be ACHIEVABLE with your goals.</h4>
When making your goals and writing them out, make sure to use action verbs to give yourself things to complete. This outline of steps will help you take specific 
actions towards accomplishing your goals.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I.E. An action oriented goal could be "I will call the cable and gas company to negotiate lower contract payments for next month."</p>

<h4>R - Be RELEVANT with your goals.</h4>
This does not mean to strive for something you don't have and want. What this means is you need to give yourself a fair shot at success. Giving yourself the opportunity 
to succeed through setting goals that you have the ability to accomplish will give you more confidence in your outcome. Every person is different so what is relevant for 
me, may not be for you. Don't sell yourself short though. You can accomplish most things barring the obvious, so don't sell yourself short when setting goals. Just remain 
level headed, realistic and relevant.
<h4>T - Create TIME-constraints for your goals.</h4>
When setting goals for the future, it is SUPER important to set a time constraint to achieve this goal.

How much time do you have available? Sometimes this is in your control and other times its not. It is important to note what category this falls in. Deciding exactly 
when you start and finish or accomplish a goal will set you off in the right direction. This is assuming all the other parts of the SMART system have been implemented 
properly.

Setting goals and sticking to the timelines you make is the foundation for any entrepreneurs eventual success. You must have this skill under your belt.
