<h4><em>"Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death." - Albert Einstein
</em></h4>

Albert Einstein is a mind beyond its time. His accomplishments have propelled human technology into a new era. Albeit, primarily warfare. His ability to envision the abstract and unknown has allowed civilization to progress consistently since his time.

His growth never slowed and never ceded. He was driven to continually develop and sharpen his mind throughout his entire life. He attributes that to a vast majority of his success. If he had not been able to learn and absorb from birth to death, the world would not be nearly the same.

Overcoming learning disabilities as a child, Albert Einstein has lived the words he spoke. Through and through, he is a man of character and success like few who have ever lived. His accomplishments will be remembered and revered for centuries if not millennia to come.
<h4>So what does this mean?</h4>
It means never stop learning. Engage at all levels in life. Be present and soak up the moments. Experience breeds knowledge and applying that knowledge is power. Success breaths it's life into those who constantly grow and develop. Back when I was in the Marines, we had a saying about staying alive. In a less lethal sense it still applies here.
<p style="text-align: center;">"Complacency kills." - Every drill instructor ever</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is true in combat, but this principle holds true in life as well. Think about it. If Steve Jobs had dropped out of college and that was it. He never learned more about his passions. Never met up with Steve Wozniak. No iPod. No Macbook. And there is a good chance that many other competitors to Apple would not have advanced so much due to a stark lack of competition.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Albert Einstein is relating the importance of continual growth the entirety of your life. From the moment you take your first breath, you are soaking in the world. It isn't until most people are adults, that they think they know what they need to and become stubborn and complacent. These are dangerous waters to tempt.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">So what can you do about it?</h4>
This, luckily, is one of those quotes that can be applied easily to your life. I will give you a basic rundown on how I apply this principle in my life. You may adapt it as necessary, but I think it should cover most peoples situations.
<ul>
 	<li>Read personal development books. Do this for perspective. Gain a different insight into yourself and begin thinking outside the box. I recommend these choices as a great option to start with. And all together they can be bought from Amazon for less than a dinner out.</li>

Reading is the easiest and most effective method to grow and change the way you think and interact with the world around you. I recommend not trying to read a book a day or some crazy stuff like that. That will do nothing but burn you out, and make you not enjoy reading. Instead of a hour on Facebook at night. Instead, go on Facebook for 15 minutes (let's face it, you aren't doing anything but scrolling most of that hour anyways) and then read a book for next 45.

Reading at night also promotes better sleep and restfulness. So read a little non fiction self help and grow as a person. Don't ever let that stop and see where it takes you. Can't be worse off then now.
