<h3><strong>What does this mean to me?</strong></h3>
Man!! This resonates with my life more than I'd like to admit. The quote implies that it is the strength we gain from pushing through 
failures and hardships that forms the foundations for our eventual success. Even taking this thought at face value lends itself to a 
good outlook. When I have failed throughout my life, whatever venture it may be in, I always try to learn from it. In that regard, my 
frustrations and my failures, have helped to shape the man that I became. Catastrophes galore, I have always come out stronger on the 
other side of whatever I got myself into. So push through! Failure is never the end of a journey.
<h4><strong>Why is triumph through adversity important?</strong></h4>
Triumph through adversity is the ability to take whatever life throws your way, and find a way to learn and grow. Each unique e<span id="dscexpitem_1280700730_5">

</span>xperience in life, both good and bad, offers an opportunity to learn. When you learn from mistakes and failures, you grow with each hards<span id="dscexpitem_1280700730_5">

</span>hip endured. It is this way that you stay out of Einsteins' definition of insanity. While that may technically be pushing through, it is not recommended.

With enough work and devotion you will come out of 99% of hardships and failures having learned something. You will be bolder and have grown as a person, if you learn to 
triumph though adversity. Remember, that in some instances the outcomes do not outweigh the effort required. In these times, it may be necessary to withdraw and reformulate 
your goals and plans. Just remember, make sure you have properly debated the decision to let go beforehand as making rash judgement calls does not help you grow.
<h4><strong>How have I applied this in my life?</strong></h4>
Every event in my life has been a stepping stone towards the final destination. MY end goals. However,  I have never reached a level of success without first being in 
destitute situations. Every failure and catastrophic event in my life was in some way my fault. Thus, I was the "black sheep" of the family growing up, due to my poor decision making.

If I had not been able to apply the lessons learned as a teenager, in my adult life I never would be where I am today. Though now, with a future actually on the horizon 
for me for the first time in my life. Serving in the USMC gave me the most tremendous trials and failures I had ever experienced up to that point. After 4 years active duty, 
I was a different man. I had grown and learned to conquer adversity with my head held high and a greater expectation on the other side.
