The Quote Of The Day today comes from George Bernard Shaw. Shaw was a prolific Irish playwright who lived through the end of the 1800's into the mid-1900's. His influence spanned centuries and still holds weight to this day. He was a thinker and writer able to convey his world with beauty and simplicity.

Sticking with the prominent theme of the quote of the day here at The Loopy Producer, I have chosen to focus on building value and creating your ideal life. To exist is not enough and surviving through it is never the goal. George Bernard Shaw exemplified this principle throughout his entire life.

Other than Bob Dylan, George Bernard Shaw is the only other person in history to win both a Nobel Prize and Academy Award for his work. Both accomplished in the first third of the last century.

Understanding that creating yourself is the goal and not finding yourself, will give you insight beyond your peers. Being able to use these as George Bernard Shaw did throughout his life will reap benefits beyond what you thought possible for yourself in this life.

But what does "creating yourself" entail? More on that now...
<h4>So What Does This Mean?</h4>
Finding yourself versus creating yourself. What is the difference here? For starters, you should never have to find yourself. You are you for the whole time. Seriously, you were never lost. Just undiscovered. Creating yourself is the process of living life to the fullest through experience and memories.

Creating yourself is not an overnight occurrence in the least. You are a masterpiece that requires precision and patience to finish. Many will not create the fullest version of themselves until later in life. For me to sit here and preach as though I have fully created myself would be a bold faced lie. I am not anywhere near my final goals. However, I actively work towards them each and every day.

I believe in the power to create your life and your legacy. Don't spend your life trying to "find yourself" while building the dreams of everyone else. Create your life. Your destiny is within your control. I do not believe in being a victim of circumstance. I know, I know...That sounds harsh. Well it kind of is. Playing the victim of circumstance card only gives you an excuse to not succeed.
<h4>You Can Help Yourself And You Will</h4>
Do you think that <strong><a href="http://www.etinspires.com">Eric Thomas</a></strong> would be anywhere near as successful as he is if he succumbed to being a victim of his circumstance. In my own life, I have been homeless, laid off, backed into corners, and put in situations I should not have emerged from alive. Yet, I never gave up. I never resulted to acting like the victim. THE ONLY REASON I AM ALIVE is because I refused to accept the outcome of the search.

I stopped searching for what I thought I was supposed to be, and decided to create my path instead. Being able to step back and look objectively at whether you are living life or surviving is crucial. Taking that first step can mean the difference between spending your whole life "searching for yourself" and spending your life "creating the version you desire"

It is true that the world is at your fingertips. You need to just pick up the brush and start painting.

I hope this helps put some perspective on life. You are not alone in your struggles and I hope reading my struggles will help you find your balance.

To your eventual and continued success in life!
