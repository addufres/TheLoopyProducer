<h5>Wealthy Affiliate Program - Product Overview</h5>
Have you ever wondered "how to make money online"? Or been scammed by "<strong>gurus</strong>" claiming to make money online for free on autopilot? These claims are far and wide, unfortunately, and it puts a bad taste in the mouth of millions around the world.

I am here to tell you to hear me out before giving up hope forever. Most of my peers spend their days struggling paycheck to paycheck straight out of college.

I hear the same thing about how "<em>adulting is hard</em>" but I have good news. Part of "<em>learning how to adult</em>" is "<em>l</em><em>earning how to money</em>".
<h3>So what exactly <em>is </em><a href="https://www.wealthyaffiliate.com/?a_aid=0337277e">Wealthy Affiliate</a>?</h3>

If you are looking to meet and network with other entrepreneurs, build a business online that generates income, give and get the best help available anywhere, and join 1,000's of experts in there field then Wealthy Affiliate will be a great new place to call home.

One thing that surprised me when<a href="https://www.wealthyaffiliate.com/a_aid/0337277e/campaign/wacustomandrewd"> I first joined WA</a>, was how active the co-founders are in the community. They regularly check up with people and are always available for a private message or specific question. As in, they are able and willing to help...<em>every day. </em>Them and everyone else on WA, will gladly help with getting websites up and running, coaching on goals, setting up ads etc. Here is Kyle posting on one of my blog posts on WA after I made my first dollar online:<img class="size-full wp-image-410 alignright" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/kyle-blog-comment.png" alt="Kyle comment on my blog" width="532" height="187" />
<h3>The Wealthy Affiliate Program Makes Sense</h3>

<hr />

Why?? Chances are, if you found this review you are looking for a few things. My guess, is you are looking for how to start a business online for no money down and be able to build and make money from it. It does not matter your skill level, your previous know how or even your prior experience and computer knowledge. Wealthy Affiliate will give you a way to pursue these dreams. If you can log into Facebook you can build a business with Wealthy Affiliate. <img class=" wp-image-411 alignright" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wealthy-affiliate-logo.png" alt="wealthy affiliate logo" width="361" height="293" />

Here are several "<strong>PROS</strong>" that I and many others love about WA:
<ul>
 	<li>The "<strong><a href="https://my.wealthyaffiliate.com/adufres/blog/certification-level-1-complete-thoughts-results-and-feedback-requests/a_aid/0337277e">Getting Started</a></strong>" training (SUPER SIMPLE and STEP-BY-STEP)</li>
 	<li>Complete online entrepreneurship Video, Tutorial and Classroom training courses</li>
 	<li>A HELPFUL community of over 800,000 active members</li>
 	<li>Spam free (NO ADS or OFFERS)</li>
 	<li>Access to Millionaire mentorship and Industry Leaders</li>
 	<li>Live help chat with 1,000's online at a time</li>
 	<li>2 FREE websites with full customization</li>
 	<li>Top of the line SECURE and FAST hosting through<strong> <a href="https://siterubix.com/?a_aid=0337277e">SiteRubix</a></strong></li>
 	<li>Over 13 fully interactive classrooms</li>
 	<li><strong>Completely 100% FREE to Get Started (no catches no credit cards)</strong></li>
</ul>
That final one was the biggest for me and many other members at WA. Many of us started with the FREE membership and upgraded to Premium once we got through the first training module. By that point, if you have FOLLOWED THE TRAINING, you should have a foundation built and be hungry for more. There is no other program in the world that brings all these aspects together in one place. For this reason I am confident that... YOU WILL LOVE YOUR TIME AND EXPERIENCE <a href="https://my.wealthyaffiliate.com/createaccount?a_aid=0337277e"><strong>AT WEALTHY AFFILIATE</strong></a>. Even still, I am so confident that if you don't like it and I am wrong, come back here and let me know about it in the comments for everyone to see. =D

You have the choice to follow a passion of yours, like I have done here at The Loopy Producer, or any other "niche". There are a near INFINITE number of routes to take when choosing a niche to write about. This starting point will be the basis and foundation for everything else you will be doing at Wealthy Affiliate. The "Getting Started" course, once inside, will break all this down in great detail to allow you to get set up in the quickest time frame possible.
<h4>Promote The Wealthy Affiliate Program Instead</h4>
There is also the option to promote the Wealthy Affiliate Program. That is perfectly fine! Wealthy Affiliate has a specific course load just for promoters of WA. They hep by being centered around the "common" theme of building a business. This training, like the other modules, are a complete step by step walk-through from bare bones basic to advanced marketing techniques.

Essentially, you are learning the most effective way to take your passion project and turn it into "Passion Profits". It all starts with JOINING WA and building your website. If you stay consistent and on track, then it will end with you having built a successful online brand from the ground up promoting and talking about things you love. There are literally TONS of ways to make money through your website but the first step is heading over to Wealthy Affiliate and getting started TODAY! If you want a more in depth view, take a look at this post from Kyle at WA, on  “<a href="http://waystoavoidscamsonline.com/how-does-the-process-of-making-money-online-work" target="_blank">how making money online works</a>”.
<h3>So What Does Wealthy Affiliate Cost?</h3>
Wealthy Affiliate has two membership price options:

<strong>Starter Membership - </strong> $0 (<strong><a href="https://www.wealthyaffiliate.com/?a_aid=0337277e" target="_blank">Join Here</a></strong>)

When I first found the Wealthy Affiliate Program, $0 forever seemed far to good to be true.

<em>Was I wrong or what?! </em>

Let me explain why...

In fact I would rather see you learn the truth about Wealthy Affiliate by joining free, long before you ever have to invest any money of your own.

In my opinion, there is no comparison when it comes to the Wealthy Affiliate Program's FREE membership for complete beginners. The only competition I could find was...
<h4><strong>Wealthy Affiliate Premium
