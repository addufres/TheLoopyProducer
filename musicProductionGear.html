<h2><strong>Music Production Gear</strong></h2>
Let's get one thing straight. If you cant use music production gear efficiently and effectively then you will have an incredibly difficult time trying to complete full songs. Tell me if this sounds at all familiar.
<ol>
 	<li style="padding-left: 30px;">You purchase a piece of equipment i.e. MIDI keyboard or controller</li>
 	<li style="padding-left: 30px;">After finding the free version you install your chosen software.</li>
 	<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Frustration peaks after you struggle learning to use the product</li>
 	<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Workflow is slow and the breaks are ruining the vibe.</li>
 	<li style="padding-left: 30px;">You blame it on bad hardware, and your music suffers.</li>
 	<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Rinse and repeat.</li>
</ol>
<h4><em><strong>Say no more to this cycle of defeat.</strong></em></h4>
This circle of buy gear, not know how to use gear, sell and buy more gear, is detrimental to your development as a producer. I know this feeling of stagnation. I have been there and it is not healthy for your passion. Want a quick way to watch the fire fizzle out?

<em>Do this with 4 or 5 grand and have a overflow of music production gear you don't use...</em>

Yes, regrettably I spent that much. What did that do? Gave me a cluttered workspace with no flow to my environment. So what did I do? I stopped buying equipment and I sat down and stopped producing music to focus solely on learning to optimize workflow and streamline the process of music production in a home studio. That coupled with a healthy amount of craigslist ads for used gear enabled me to cut the fat from my studio, and create an organized and optimized space. I talk more about ways to declutter and optimize<span style="color: #3366ff;"> <a style="color: #3366ff;" href="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/tutorials">here</a></span>. Check it out!
