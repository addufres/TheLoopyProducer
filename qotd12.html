<h2>Success Quote of the Day - 3/4/17</h2>
<h5><em><strong>"Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit." - Napoleon Hill</strong></em></h5>
Thinker, innovator, and all around great guy Napoleon Hill has changed the outlook on life for more people than most in history. He penned the classic self help bible Think and Grow Rich back in the early 20th century. His thoughts on success and ideas on personal development are still very relevant in today's changing and wild world. <strong>

<h4><strong>So what does this even mean?</strong></h4>

It may not be cryptic with its message, but Napoleon Hill is known for making his readers think and ponder the meaning of his words. Essentially, what he is saying is that the successful people are the ones who never gave up.

The people who push through ALL of the B.S. in life, are the ones who accomplish greatness. The reward of persistence is success.

Take a hobby for instance...such as, building a race car in your garage at home. The success in this goal is not financial and that is important to note. Success can come in all forms and these quotes and insights are not meant to be used strictly with business, but life in general. In this case, success is the completion of a project.

I can tell you from my "polished turd" of a race car that it may sit for months at a time while the next part is saved up for and sought after. But no matter how long the steps take, steps are being taken consistently. As soon as one is complete the next begins.

Why?... Because the moment I give up on taking action towards my goal, my goal is done. Failed.

It takes a level of "bull-headedness", to push through crappy times.
<h4><em><strong>"Failure is not an option"</strong></em></h4>
When I was serving in the Marine Corps down at Camp Pendleton, I faced my fair share of challenges, goals, success, and failure. There is one common theme throughout each time I succeeded. I never quit. I never gave up.

If that hill was still 10 miles out, and I am dehydrated carrying more than I'd ever need to carry ANYWHERE...I just kept taking steps. Each step I knew I was a little closer to being done.

And when you do finish, holy crap do you feel on top of the world. It doesn't even matter what your goal is. By pushing through and seeing it to completion, you gain a sense of worth and confidence that does not compare to much else.

Success is the greatest drug in the world. It makes you blind with focus and determination. Able to see past any hump in the way. It is the reason success has caused people to forget to eat, sleep etc. Success makes you hungry for more. So with each step you take, reflect and be proud of making that step. No matter how small it may be, it shows devotion and forward momentum.
<h4><em><strong>"When there is nothing but passion"</strong></em></h4>
This blog at this moment of writing this gets close to no visitors, makes no money. So why would I keep going? Because I have a goal and I have a dream to help as many people as I can. By continuing to write every day and bring what I hope is considered value to the world, people will begin to notice and listen. I will be able to build my client base and build my business to be able to reach more and more people.

You need to be able to stick it out. Plain and simple, if you want success in your life. Whatever that may mean to you, you have to stick it out. I can not be any more clear. Almost every post here emphasizes the importance of remaining persistent and sticking to the course. The day you quit is the day you have quit on your future.
<h4><em><strong>"Moving Forward"</strong></em></h4>
Remember that and when times get tough fall back on your "WHY". Don't have a why yet check out my <a href="http://theloopyproducer.com/blogging-and-making-money">10 Tips on Building a Business Online</a>. Your WHY is what will pull you through those moments of despair and defeat. It will carry you towards your success horizon.

You and only you can make the choice to live a better life than you have now. It begins with a decision and it ends by not ever stopping the effort. Napoleon Hill hit the nail right on the head with this. Your efforts will only pay you back by seeing your goal to completion.
