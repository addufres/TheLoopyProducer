<h1>Success Quote of the Day 3/5/17 - Buddha Quotes</h1>
<h5><em><strong>"All experiences are preceded by mind, having mind as their master, created by mind" - Buddha from Dhammapada 1</strong></em></h5>
The Buddha is attributed to numerous quotes and saying. However, many Buddha quotes are falsely associated to the text the Dhammapada. I did not want to share a potentially false quote and base a whole lesson around it. No matter how true the concept may be. My belief is if you are going to do something, then do it right. So I found a quote and then traced it back to the original text. Though I am not a Buddhist, the teachings of morality and balance in life have guided my actions and helped shape the man I became.

<h3><strong>So What The Heck Does This Mean?</strong></h3>

<hr />

Three words:
<ol>
 	<li>THOUGHTS</li>
 	<li>FEELINGS</li>
 	<li>ACTIONS</li>
</ol>
I know. I know...That is way oversimplified. But in reality and practice, that is how this quote is implemented. Your mind as master (thoughts/feelings) and experiences (the actions you take). This hit home with me. The majority of my life I struggled with the cycle of defeat that was fulfilled by these three things. My thoughts dictated the direction my emotions and feelings took.

If I thought that my day would be a bad day then I would have negative outlook. That negative outlook, in turn, would make me irritable and short fused all day. My negative attitude and emotional state would close my mind off to recognizing opportunities. I would not have found many things in life had my cycle been a negative one.
<h3><strong>Be The Master Of Your Mind</strong></h3>

<hr />

The other part of this quote is centered around self-awareness. The idea that you are the master of your own mind is foreign to many. Too many people hold the belief that they are at the whim of their emotions. Rather than looking inside at their internal dialogue and taking responsibility for the instability in their life. Good or bad, you mind is yours to control.

<strong>TOUGH LOVE TIME:</strong> You are not a victim of circumstance. Your experience in life is dictated by your ability to control your thoughts and emotions. If you cannot do this you will never find true happiness and balance in your life. Sorry, not sorry.

Being better than you were the day before is a choice you make each and every morning when you wake up. It does not take special circumstance to give reason to change. If you are unhappy with the way life is, then change.

That's it. Plain and simple. It is a choice because you are the master of your mind. Master your mind and you master your emotions. Master your emotions and your needed actions will become much more clear. Define your goal, and take deliberate action.
<h3><strong>So How The Heck Do I Use This?</strong></h3>

<hr />

Great question, glad you asked...<img class="wp-image-467 alignleft" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/fork_in_the_road.jpg" alt="fork in the road quote of the day" width="319" height="202" />

Life is definitely a cycle and comes full circle several times throughout it. Being centered and balanced in life cannot be stressed enough. Although, it will be very hard to implement abstract concepts in real life so I will share with you my method I use to keep control of my internal dialogue.

It takes a deliberate choice to correct thoughts on the spot.

Every time you have a thought that is negative towards your goals and dreams, stop. Stop what you are doing and verbally correct your thought out loud. Sounds crazy I know, but, being able to hear your own voice say the contrary to the thought you had will help stop those thoughts from occurring on their own. With practice and focus you will notice over time that instead of the initial thought being negative, you will naturally think the positive alternatives.
<h3><strong>What You Tell Yourself Matters</strong></h3>

<hr />

Robert Kiyosaki demonstrated this in his book "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" (one of my favorites, btw =D). He talks about how controlling your thoughts allow you to see perspectives and opportunities you otherwise would not. An easy demonstration of this would be:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Â Say you want a bigger house. Pretty generic goal and I would be upset if any of my readers set goals as bland and unapproachable as this, but I digress. A bigger house for the sake of example is the goal. Two people have this goal. John tells himself, "I want a bigger house, but I CAN'T afford it." James tells himself, "I want a bigger house, so HOW CAN I afford it." The difference here is that James is opening the door for his mind to work and look and search for opportunities that would allow him to pursue a bigger house. John has made his mind up that he can't do it. Therefore, his brain has stopped doing work.</p>

<h3><strong>It Works If You Work It</strong></h3>

<hr />

I would almost guarantee that James will fare better in his quest for a bigger house. Why? Because he has become the master of his mind. Be commanding a different internal voice, James makes room for new opportunities to arise in every day affairs. He may be at work, and because he is actively engaged with the idea of finding a way to fund a new house he may ask for a raise he wouldn't have earlier. Maybe, he is excelling in his work because at the back of his mind he knows that every little bit will help him.

Point is, your life is nothing more than how you view it. If you view the world as, pardon my french, but shitty, then you are almost sure to be surrounded by the same caliber of people and experience the same caliber of moments. You are the sum of what you surround yourself with.
<p style="text-align: left;">So today, when you have a thought that doesn't align with your goals, do what I mentioned here. It only takes changing one part of the Thoughts, Feelings, Actions triangle to begin the transition of your whole outlook. Do yourself a favor and make a change for the better.
