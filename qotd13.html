<h2>Success Quote of the Day - 3/3/17</h2>
<h5><strong><em><span style="color: #333333;">"Success is the sum of small efforts - repeated day in and day out." - Robert Collier</span></em></strong></h5>
Robert Collier was a man ahead of his time. When it comes to new ways of thinking and becoming a better you, Robert Collier is one of the founding fathers. He was born at the end of the 1800s and authored over a dozen self help books. His guidance and knowledge has fueled change in countless lives. And, his quotes really hit home for me.
<h4><em>So what does this mean?</em></h4>

Holy CRAP! I have been saying this for years. Actually, it wasn't even a book of Robert Colliers' that gave me this glimpse. It was actually a core concept in one of my favorite books, The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy. The whole journey of success should come from within. And, this whole website is about bettering yourself. If you look closely, in every posting I mention the importance of consistency.

Why??

Because consistency is king! Consistency produces results. What is The Loopy Producer if I'm not helping my clients produce results! We are producers after all. I don't think this quote needs a real breakdown...I mean come on, it's a straightforward as can be.
<ol>
 	<li>Be consistent in your daily habits</li>
 	<li>Make sure to cover the small things in life.</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong><em>"Be consistent in your daily habits"</em></strong></h5>
Okay yeah...I get it. You do the same thing everyday, but you are no different from last year or the year before this time.

<strong>TOUGH LOVE TIME</strong> - You are right you do the same thing each day. But are your daily habits, successful habits? Do you have a REAL goal set, or are you like most people who want the idea of success but don't want to do the work to get it.

It takes work. Hard work and long hours. But paying mind to take care of the small things and watch the bigger pieces seem so much easier.
<h5><em><strong>"Cover the small stuff"</strong></em></h5>
You would be surprised how little people think this through. Example, some of you may be students and did not perform the way you had hoped the prior semester. There are two types of people in this situation and the way they handle it shows the habits of success...or lack of.
<ol>
 	<li>Joe Success got a "C" last semester in one of his major classes. Immediately upon recognizing the problem, he takes care of all the small things he should have this year prior to even starting the following semester. This includes researching professors and signing up early. It includes finding tutoring and education aid. All before the beginning of the next class.</li>
 	<li>Suzie Stressed got a "C" last semester and decided she wanted to do better. She read all over how to do better. Gathered all these ideas on how to do better. But come next class all she has done is look up from more and more places "how to get better". In the process, fulfilling the cycle because she is no longer prepared for the next class and most likely will have a similar outcome</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong><em>A lesson in being consistent</em></strong></h4>
Be consistent and deliberate with every action you take throughout the day. It is not enough to want to and plan to be consistent. Having the dream of being successful is not enough for most people to get off their ass and do something about it.

That means doing the same thing day in and day out to achieve success. It may mean staying up late and getting up early to accomplish what is needed. These paths to success are not by accident. They are deliberate, measured actions taken every single day to reach a point of success.

It is not and never will be enough to simply research and daydream about changing your situation. If you do not grab life by the horns and take control, life will control you and your life will have no control.

I hope today is the day that you go out and produce the life you want. Take action. Be consistent.

To your eventual and continued success!
