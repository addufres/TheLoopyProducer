<h3>How to Start A Blog For Free And Fund Your Passions</h3>
If you are at all like me, you don't want to work 40 hours a week until the day you die busy building someone else's dreams instead of funding your passions. Most of you probably have the dream of funding your passions and do what you love, but what alternatives are there for real? I will show you many things like how to start a blog for free and monetize it. And yes, it takes hard work. I am sure that you have read some spam email chain about some "guru" promising you $$$$$ hand over fist every day with zero work. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but,

<em><strong>IT'S ALL BULLSHIT!!</strong></em>

Now I am sure that you have already figured that out, but if you are like most people you probably assumed it was never going to happen for you, and you would suffer doing what you love in between the time you do what you must to pay bills.

This is not how life is supposed to work. Life isn't supposed to be work. That does not mean there is no work in life. I will be the first to proclaim the value of dedication and hard work towards a goal or specialty. The difference is who benefits from YOUR work. Funding your passions instead of funding others.

In addition, this page will consist of motivational segments for those moments where you just need a pick me up. I have been developing a platform to begin my journey as a Life Designer and Motivational Coach. This is where I will begin to offer hope and happiness.

Similar to other great motivators such as,<span style="color: #ffff00;"> <a style="color: #ffff00;" href="https://darrenhardy.com/">Darren Hardy</a></span>,<span style="color: #ffff00;"> <a style="color: #ffff00;" href="http://etinspires.com/">Eric Thomas</a></span>, and<span style="color: #ffff00;"> <a style="color: #ffff00;" href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/">Tony Robbins</a></span>, I plan to author books on personal development and dream actualization. After all is said and done, I feel very strongly about enabling others to realize and achieve their full potential. The feeling when someone thanks you for helping them change their situation is indescribable. It makes you crave more like an addiction. However, I am addicted to growth and potential.
