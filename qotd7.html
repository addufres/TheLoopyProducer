<h2>Success Quote Of The Day - March 9, 2017</h2>
<h4><em>"Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work." - Thomas Edison<img class=" wp-image-499 alignright" src="http://theloopyproducer.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/download.jpeg" alt="thomas edison success quote of the day" width="245" height="316" /></em></h4>

Thomas Edison...The American businessman and inventor who created not only the light bulb, but patented over 1,000 inventions over his lifetime. His ability to think outside the box and work hard to achieve his dreams drove him to tremendous success.

A stark thinker and true visionary, Thomas Edison has gone down in history as "one of the greats". His wisdom, if heeded, will bring color and success to your passions as well. Let's face it, the guy did what he loved. And what, if any, is the point to my whole shindig here if not to do what I love and teach y'all to do the same.
<h3>So what does this mean?</h3>
It means get off your lazy butt. That's what it means. It means that opportunity in life is not always pristine and perfect. Sometimes...no correction, ALL THE TIME in life, you need to bust your chops to get to the reward. The cherry on top, per say.

The problem arises when people have the dream of being a CEO of their own company. They imagine themselves as the CEO without ever imagining the 5-10 year build up to that point. That does not mean go take crap jobs because opportunity is there. It does mean, however, that you will need to be willing to sacrifice immediate happiness for success down the road.

No, not depressed. But, sometimes, you will find yourself doing things that simply aren't what you want to do. Grit your teeth and bear it. I promise you will gain insight and experience. Knowledge and understanding. By opening your eyes to all the ways to achieve your goals, you will be presented with opportunity. Plain. And. Simple.
<h4>So what do you do about it?</h4>
Simple. Look for opportunity in all places. Open your eyes to things you have been closed off to in the past. Nothing outrageous, but simple things. For example; taking the side job where you may be introduced to a contractor who is doing exactly what you need. You would never have found them had you not taken an intermediate job.

Think of these opportunity finders as "stepping stones" on your journey across the river of life. Deep right? In my life I have taken many stepping stones in search of opportunity to grow. I have joined network marketing companies to learn cold-call sales. At one point I owned an insurance agency to understand more about customer relationships and staff management.

It does not matter one bit what your end goal is. The point Thomas Edison tried to make with this quote, is that with a closed eye mindset on success opportunity will never present itself. Success requires hard work. Period. But, pushing through, finding the right opportunity, and see it to completion will bring your goal closer to reach.
