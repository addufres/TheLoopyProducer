<h4><em>"Wealth is the ability to fully experience life" - Henry David Thoreau
</em></h4>

His ideas on transcendentalism, history, and philosophy have helped me personally to gain insight and breadth of view.

His work was prolific to say the lease. Amassing a portfolio of more than 20 volumes, Henry David Thoreau wrote input on numerous facets of life. These ranged from politics to nature. From living fulfilled to success methods.

I highly recommend his work Walden. It can be snagged here from Amazon for less than 10 bucks. So do yourself a favor and take a read.

<h4>So what does this mean?</h4>
First off, I would like to just ask, "Anyone notice a theme yet?" As in, wealth is not defined by your bank account? I hope so. It may seem backwards, but, the less you focus on money and the more you focus on value in your life, the more financial success you are likely to achieve.

Let me break this down. As Henry David Thoreau says, go out and experience life. Take in the experience of daily interaction. Don't take these instances for granted. It is in these moments when you are most likely to run into someone who will catapult your life further along.

The other way to think about experiencing life is seeing experiences as fulfillment. Spending quality time and having a work-life balance gives you the ability to experience life to the fullest. Don't rush from one task to another. Take your time and learn. Grow and adapt with each new experience. The feeling of completion you feel can be described as wealth.
<h4>But I need money...</h4>
Doesn't everyone? Ever notice how the more you focus on enjoying yourself or being there for your loved ones, the more complete and happy you feel? The same is true for wealth. Valuing the wealth in your life now will put your mind towards creating more wealth. It is a natural cycle, and it works against you too.

Just like focusing on the good brings more good...Focusing on how awful everything is will only make you focus more on the negative. So enjoy your experiences, and experience all that you can. Being wealthy do not necessarily mean fat stacks of cash. To many people wealthy=bills paid and time to spend money on hobbies. Some people prefer happiness to monetary gain.

This does not mean they don't care about money. It means that the money they make pales in comparison to the enjoyment they get from living that life. So live to your potential and live through experience. The wealth will fill in on its own.
