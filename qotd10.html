<h4><em><strong>So What The Heck Does This Mean?</strong></em></h4>
Well, first off this quote is referring to being <em>effective</em> in your work. Busy work is bad. But being busy at work can be good. It is all dependent on what steps are being taken and what the goal is you set out to achieve. What Wooden is saying here is that even though you may be filling your time with "things" to do, you may not be moving forward at all.

In life, there is an infinite number of options to how a goal can turn out. Being able to identify what is wasteful and what is working is crucial to being successful in anything. For example:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You want to lose thirty pounds by summer and its March now. So you start reading about all the different options out there for exercising and diet. Before you know it a month has passed, no gym has been set foot in, and you are still "trying to decide" what program to stick to. You have been busy "at work" doing all kinds of things. Making pro/con lists and planning out meals. Only one part is missing....actually doing any work.</p>

<h4><em><strong>So What Now?</strong></em></h4>
So you see, filling your time with relevant activity is not enough. In order to achieve something...anything really, you need to take decisive and calculated actions that will actually move you closer with each day. Your goals cannot wait. Plain and simple. you are worth more than putting the hard stuff aside to trick yourself into thinking you're being productive.

You have made the decision to come read The Loopy Producer for tips tricks and butt-kicking motivation. This little trick many people play on themselves is one of the biggest killers in dreams and goals. So, don't just do <em>stuff </em>to do <em>stuff. </em>Make your plan before you set off on the journey and create a set of steps to accomplish. A checklist if you will.

The more comprehensive you make your path to follow, the less likely you are to stray from that path. Don't give yourself a reason to do busy work. Keep yourself busy working on your goals instead. If you do this consistently. And, only if consistency happens, then you will achieve 99% of goals you set out to achieve. I say 99% because sometimes life just kicks you when you're down and you just need to take it and get back up. But that is for another day.
<h6><em><strong>And as always...</strong></em></h6>
